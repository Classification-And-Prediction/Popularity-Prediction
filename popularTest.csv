Can I stop a WhatsApp message from being delivered?	whatsapp-messenger	If I delete a message with a single tick, does that just get deleted from my local device ( Android) or does it no longer get delivered to the recipient?  
How do I change the Google Play country?	google-play-store localization	Can someone tell me how to change the country preference for Google Play? I have searched high and low but in most of the forums people ask you to go to gmail settings > edit profile and change the country there. But there is no place to change the country in settings! There is a something called place (which can be marked as current) but that has no impact on Google play. I dont want to circumvent country restrictions, I want to permanently change the country. So its NOT a duplicate of this: How can I circumvent regional restrictions in the Android Market?  
I've rooted my phone. Now what? What do I gain from rooting?	rooting root-access	This is a common question by those who have just rooted their phones. What apps, ROMs, benefits, etc. do I get from rooting? What should I be doing now?  
Getting "Authentication is required" when trying to access the Play Store	google-play-store google-account authorization	Over the past week, whenever I try to open the Play Store/Market app on my phone, the app thinks for a while and then displays this error message: Authentication is required. You need to sign into your Google Account. But I am indeed signed into my Google account, as seen in other Google applications running on the phone, and as seen if I open the menu in the Market app and click the "Accounts" button. I suspect this might be related to the fact that over the past few months I've had two different Google accounts synced to this device, and I have recently removed one of them from the phone. No other Google application has had any problems with removing one account. Does anyone know how I can solve this issue? I can still install applications by using the market website (now "Google Play"), but this is still a big inconvenience. I also think I stopped getting updates.  
AC3 codec for MX Player	media-player	Since the latest MX Player upgrade, AC3 is not included because of some licensing issues. How can I add a codec to MX player? I did search the play store, but all codecs seem to be connected to a specific player.  
How to change the account for Android Market?	google-play-store google-account accounts	I use two Google accounts and add them to . Let's say acc1 and acc2. When I try to buy an app in the Market, it chooses acc1's Checkout account, and I don't see an option to change to acc2. Can I use acc2 to pay this? And I still want acc1 as the main account for other purposes. (i.e. Talk, Mail, contacts) Possibly related question: How Do I Know Which Google Account is Used for the Market?
How can I determine if my device has USB Host Mode (OTG) support?	usb-host-mode usb-on-the-go	Some Android devices can act as a USB host, so that you can use other USB devices attached to them. For instance, browse or import the photos stored on a camera from your phone, or copy files onto a USB memory stick attached to your tablet, plug a full-size USB keyboard or mouse into a tablet, or use an external GPS or wifi device. How can I tell if my device can do this?  
Can not unlock my Android device as have no internet connection?	lock-screens locked-out	I have an Android device which is running Android 4.0.3 (or something like that). My little brother decided to try and guess my lock screen pattern the other day, and ended up locking me out. I have since been unable to log back in to the tablet using my Google Account details. I provided the correct login details, however it says they are incorrect. Could this be connected to the fact I have no internet connection? I have no internet connection as the device is WiFi only, and the WiFi is currently turned off. I cannot turn it on, as I am locked out. How can I log back into my tablet without wiping the user data?  
What can I do to manage my phone's internal storage?	internal-storage insufficient-memory	If you're not used to seeing the 'low on internal storage' notification, what is it that you're doing to keep your phone's internal memory from filling up so quickly? The 'SD Card and Phone Storage' menu in the settings doesn't really tell me much other than how much is free. And, I don't really have that many applications installed. The top 5 storage hogging apps on my phone are Gmail (18.6 MB), Twitter (17.5 MB), Facebook (12.55 MB), Maps (9.63 MB), and Swype (6.06 MB). So, are there apps out there (besides your normal file manager ones, like Astro) that will help monitor internal phone storage? Is there something I should be doing to keep my phone storage use to a minimum?  
How to change my device location on the Play Store	google-play-store google-account	I'm trying to download an App on the Play Store, specifically the Vue Cinema app, but this app is only (presumably) available in the UK. I have just relocated to the UK, so how do I set my location to be the UK? I have updated my google+ settings to say that I am currently in the UK. Also, my google account is a Google Apps account but I don't there is any location associated with Google Apps.
