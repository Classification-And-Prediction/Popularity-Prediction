1	''insufficient space on the device'' but my sd card has plenty space?	insufficient-memory storage	I bought my Android phone a month ago (a Prestigio 3350 Duo ) and installed maybe 5 apps on it, so according to the memory card I have almost 2 gb of free space, and 28 mb on internal storage. But when I try to install some apps it keeps showing off that message. I don't know why, tried to clear cache (which helped a little) but still I can't install an app of about 34 mb. Can someone help me fix this problem? I know there're similar posts but I appreciate any help. Thanks :)

1	Unable to connect Galaxy S3 to PC via USB	usb samsung-galaxy-s-3 connection-issues troubleshooting	I've had my Galaxy S3 for a few months now, and have always been able to connect to my PC via USB. A few days ago, it suddenly stopped working. I've found many other Android.SE threads , but none have been able to answer my question. Symptoms: when I plug the phone in via USB, the phone beeps, I get a lightning bolt on my battery, but that's it. There are no USB options in the pull-down status bar, and the PC does not recognize that a device has been plugged in. Click screenshot for full size.

1	Samsung Galaxy S3 keeps restarting, stuck on Samsung logo	samsung-galaxy-s-3 reboot	Two days ago I got the official update of jelly bean 4.3 to my Samsung Galaxy S3. Last night phone was dropped from a small height. Today morning when I switched on the phone it worked fine. But in the evening, suddenly my phone restarted and goes to Samsung Logo Splash Screen (Samsung galaxy S3 GT-I9300T) and keeps rebooting. I removed the battery and insert it after a few second. After that the phone worked fine and again the same problem happened. If I remove the battery to switch off the phone and if I insert the battery again, phone switch on by itself (without press power button) and keep restarting. I try to open the Home + Volume Up + Power On button option. But is not working. If I plug the phone to charge, gray battery shows and again restarting to charge. (I mean, phone wont stay in a stage). If i try Home + Voulme Down + Power On option, phone shows the download mode for 5 seconds and restarts again. So can you please let me know its a software problem or hardware problem? If its a software how to fix it ? ( I tried the emergency firmware recovery through kies, but kies couldnt fine my phone).

1	I've deleted Google Play Store. How can I reinstall it?	google-play-store 4.0-ice-cream-sandwich htc-sensation	I've been having an issue with my apps where an error " Package file is invalid " keeps appearing. I read a tutorial somewhere which told me to "uninstall updates" for the Google Play Store application. I was told doing this would uninstall the application, and then the device would automatically reinstall Google Play Store. I did this, restarted my phone, but the application never reappeared. I think tried downloading an .apk file to install this manually, but on install the application wouldn't load. Has anyone done this before? How can I reinstall this application? I believe I need it for all future downloads and updates to my applications. For the record, my phone is not rooted.

1	HTC Desire low on internal storage, I'm clueless -- Any help?	htc-desire internal-storage storage insufficient-memory	It's been bugging me for a while but getting quite bad lately. I get warnings that my internal storage is full, I have about 13mb left of what I believe is 512mb worth of rom. I have checked with the app "diskusage" and my apps take about 122mb, with about 20 more mb being used by "data" (unsure what this is). When I check the apps list, my biggest app is some 12mb, and even within the first screen of apps this drops to just over 6mb. So I don't have extremely big apps, and I don't have all that much of them either. I try to put most on my sdcard, so no problem there either. How do I figure out what's hogging all this space, and how do I fix it ? On a related note, what is the Android equivalent of "formatting" your phone? I believe factory settings doesn't remove all data (sdcard etc) or does it? EDIT: I have done a hard reset on my phone, and the free space available is somewhat similar to what I saw before. So, is it normal to only have about 150mb available for apps when the internal rom should be 512mb ?

1	My device is getting slow, apps start misbehaving/crashing. What can I do?	performance crashes	Everything was working fine for a long time. But suddenly the device is getting slower than usual (e.g. apps react slowly when starting an action -- like the RSS reader takes "ages" to open an article). Also, several apps start crashing: force-closes as well as unexpected restarts. Sometimes this even involves some automatic reboot of the device. Is there anything I can do, besides doing a factory-reset? Preferably it should work on un-rooted devices. Remark: not all described problems may occur together, so on one device e.g. there might be no automatic reboot involved. Question remains the same, nonetheless.

1	Why am I constantly running out of space on my Galaxy S2?	samsung-galaxy-s-2 storage insufficient-memory	I have a Galaxy S2 running Android 4.1.2. It has a 12GB internal HD, and a 16GB SD card. I keep getting errors from various programs telling me I am running out of space. BeyondPod won't download new episodes, Evernote keeps putting up a notification of a lack of space (even though it seems to be storing everything), and sometimes apps won't update. I have tried to ensure I have no superfluous apps, and I haven't really changed the apps I use since I first ever started using the device. I keep any large files, like music collections or videos, on my SD card. When I connect my device by USB to my Linux computer and check the properties of my 12GB HD, it says 9.9 GB is used. But if I browse the files, every folder seems to have barely kilobytes of information. Why is my 12GB HD filling up, and how do I clear it out so I don't get these errors? Update: My phone is rooted, so if that is something that can help me in this situaton, then root access is available to me.

1	How to change the (permanent) MAC address on my android phone?	mac-address	In the past months, I've got 2 Chinese Android cells (Froyo) based on MTK6515. They work fine but we started having lot of trouble attempting access to internet, and after a while I found out that both phones they have the same MAC address, which causes connection problems. So, I'm looking for a procedure that could change the devices' MAC addresses and solve our trouble. I found a method which involves changing the file at /etc/wl/NVRAM.TXT , but after referencing a couple posts around the webs, it turns out my phones do not have this folder (and thus the other files inside). Any clue? Please don't tell me a pray about that MAC addresses are burned into a chip, at least not in these devices, because I've already lost their IMEI's too (by hard reset), but I've recovered them and they're functional now.

But if I try to call my home number or anything it tells me "That is not an emergency call." What does it let through? Is it only 911 ? Is there any way to tell it to allow a certain set of numbers from the emergency button, like to set a list of emergency numbers such as: 911 , Home and Wife ? This would seem like it would be very useful, so if someone finds you smooshed on the road, they know these certain people should be called.

I already know that if I save numbers on my SIM card they will be transferred but I can't save everything on it.

So my question is how to sync as much of my data from BlackBerry to my Android phone without using Google Sync?

1	How can I free up more space on my Android (2.2 Froyo) phone?	2.2-froyo htc-desire internal-storage	I have already moved all the applications that allow it to the SD card. So what I am really looking for here are some tips like clearing internet cache or something like that. (I have an HTC Desire.) Edit: In my case the top space hogs are: Google Reader - 19.1 MB Swype - 10.7 MB Maps - 9.2 MB Contacts Storage 8.9 MB SliceIt - 8.2 MB doubleTwist - 6.4 MB Facebook for HTC Sense - 5.9 MB Handcent SMS - 5.0 MB Adobe Reader - 4.7 MB Gmail - 4.2 MB and there are many more after that (TweetDeck, Bloomberg, Angry Birds, Shazam, ...). Now I know that I have a lot of apps but that's what I want from my smart phone and I don't really want to have to uninstall anything. I've also got a 16GB SD card which is over 50% empty so if only more of the apps would allow themselves to be moved to the SD. EDIT 2: I found this question - How can I deal with "Low on space" messages on my HTC Incredible? which deals with the same issue and the accepted answer there is very good. 
1	How do I grant root privileges to an app?	root-access	I have installed Root Explorer on my HTC G12 phone. When try to view /init.rc , it shows 'No root privilege' and ask me to root my phone. It seems Root Explorer didn't run as root (or this process is not added to some group with storage access). And, it seems on a non-rooted device, when the phone boots up, we are logged in as a non-root user. Where does Android control the log-in user's privilege level? Is it in the init process?

1	Car Mode suddenly appeared - why? And how do I get rid of it?	cyanogenmod htc-evo	About 2 1/2 hrs ago, I plugged in my HTC Evo 4G to its home charger to charge up a bit before leaving the house. It's rooted running CyanogenMod-7.1.0-Supersonic (for at least a month if not more, I can't remember when my husband did this). Within about 3 minutes, my phone had this really weird user interface I have never seen. It's Car Mode. I couldn't exit out of it, couldn't make my phone respond to me at all. I immediately pulled out the battery &amp; rebooted, thinking maybe it was malware. It booted back into Car Mode, only this time I could click an Exit button. Researching, I see that this is an UI for car docking. Only I have no car dock, and it was plugged into my home wall charger. I left the house for errands, and no matter what I did - on the phone on a voice call, typing email (at a doctor's office, not driving ;) ), and it kept booting me into Car Mode. On the voice call it automatically put me on speaker. I did not ask for this program, did not download anything, did not approve anything... I ran Lookout and no Malware or Spyware is showing. I am very confused. Anyone have ideas on what this program is, how it all of a sudden appeared on my phone, and how to get it off? I looked up apps in Google Play and the icon in the notifications bar (when I exit Car Mode) is not something that is there. It looks like an app, but it's not in my Apps manager, either, or a running process that I can tell, yet it is showing up intermittently in my notifications, even not plugged in or moving. It's also turning on intermittently. I can't get anything done. Thanks for any help!

1	How to make volume buttons on earphones/headphones work with Android?	audio volume-control headphones	I'm on the hunt for a great sounding, non-in-ear set of headphones with working mic, play/pause, and volume buttons. I have Bang &amp; Olufsen's EarSet 3i , which are among the best sounding headphones I've ever used. And all three button work perfectly in my MacBook Air and iPhone. Obviously they don't work perfectly in my Nexus 4, since Android devices uses a different way of reading volume up/down buttons. So, my question is rather simple, does anyone know how to make them work with Android, or alternatively any equally good headphones to the EarSet 3i's that work on Android? And to make it extra challenging, no in-ear ones please, cause I can't stand them :( Or maybe anyone knows of some kind of adapter cable that can be used between an Android phone and iPhone compatible headphones to translate the volume button signals so the Android device understands them?

The fact is, my device storage memory is full but my SD memory card is empty. I have an Android based Samsung Galaxy. 
1	I can't send a picture attachment together with a text message any more ( Samsung Galaxy S). Any idea why?	samsung-galaxy-s sms attachment	I tried to send a text message - attaching a photo already on my phone ( the first time ) and attaching a picture taken at time of send ( the second time ). However, when I try to send this text message - the status remains sending ( an my correspondent does not receive the message ). Is this a problem with my phone company, you think, or can I have changed some setting somehow. Is there a setting that can be set, anyhow ? I did send picture attachments with text message before , some weeks ago , but not after upgrading to Froyo 2.2.1 ( just to be complete - can't think this has anything to do with it ). ------------- [ UPDATE ]------------------------- Something I noticed but did not mention before : if I view a text message with a picture attached , and press the image to 'view' it,*a sort of movie view is started*e.g. with the picture at the top of the screen, and a Start , Rewind and Forward button at the bottom. Pressing the Start will 'play' the picture as move of about 5 seconds - since it is a picture, of course the image does not change. I am pretty sure this was not the case when I sent some image messages a couple of weeks ago. To be complete: even the image messages I did send before now show this 'movie' type of action. 
1	What does "avoided poor Internet connection" mean?	wi-fi internet connection-issues	The connection to my work wifi just failed and below the network my phone is saying "Avoided poor Internet connection" . What does this mean exactly? Has the phone detected that it can't get out to the wider Internet or did the network fail to allocate an IP address or something else? Not sure if it matters but this is on a Galaxy Nexus.

1	application cannot be installed in the default install location?	applications installation	I have an Android Galaxy S1, and have been getting the error "application cannot be installed in the default install location". I am aware that this is a common issue. So I Googled it, and almost everyone is saying to move your apps to the SD card or delete unused games. There's only one problem. My phone won't let me move apps into the SD card, and I have 1.3GB of free app space. While I can download some apps, the more important ones won't download. Anyone have any fixes to this? 
1	Google Play: Error downloading app - insufficient space	google-play-store internal-storage samsung-galaxy-tab insufficient-memory	After one of the latest updates (not sure if it was the last one or a previous one) of the Google Play app, I am having an error trying to update a large app (42MB). It says: Error Downloading . There is insufficient space on the device. My device is a Samsung P1000 running Froyo. It's rooted, but the error was there before rooting it. A quick Google search showed several Samsung users having the same problem (the app in question that was giving me the headache is Smurf's village). Some said that removing the updates to the Android Market (Google Play) app would fix it, but to me it was of no avail. I also tried the procedure in this Google help FAQ to no avail. Now I am stuck with a prehistoric version of the Market (that works on small apps) and still cannot update Smurf's Village or install big apps. How can I fix this? EDIT: device has over 2GB of internal SD storage, 27GB of external SD card, so space is not an issue. 
1	Charging paused. Battery temperature too high or too low	battery charging	I have a Samsung Galaxy player that has been giving me the message "Charging paused.

1	Block apps from accessing the Internet on Android device	internet	In Android, is it possible to block apps from accessing the Internet? Many apps will often connect to remote servers in the background, including Google's own apps or system services. Over time this can eat away at a user's data limit set by a mobile carrier. Does Android allow an app to act as a firewall whereby the user can select which apps have access to the Internet? Or does the device have to be rooted to have that ability? 
1	Are there any Android browsers that support loading a Java Applet in-browser?	browser java	We have a client who are switching away from Windows Mobile (and IE Mobile) to Android based devices. We have some specific software that we deploy to their WM workforce by an ActiveX applet that loads in IE Mobile, but obviously Android will have no support for ActiveX. So we will need to re-do our application to an Android-specific platform, and Java is the obvious choice for this. Are there any Android browsers that support loading a Java Applet in-browser, in much the same way an ActiveX applet loads in IE (i.e. it fully integrates into the browsing experience).

1	Connect an Android tablet to ethernet	usb networking samsung-galaxy-tab	I use tablet with Android in a professional environment and the it department doesn't accept to install wifi. My tablet need to synchronise with CSV file on a LAN share. I'm looking for solutions. Is it possible to connect a tablet on ethernet (possibly with builtin firmware)? If yes, which model? I looked for solutions and I found some interesting links: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1274656 / a pack to add ethernet support to Asus http://www.sosandroid.fr/forumAndroid/topic1980.html Iconia Tab a500 http://discuz-android.blogspot.fr/2011/07/step-by-step-to-enable-lan-access-for.html Motorola Xoom Does someone have experience with this? I prefer avoid root my tablet or use a custom firmware or launch some custom command when connected to the network, but if no Android tablet come with this feature built in, I would be willing to root it. Alternate solution: connect the tablet to the PC with USB and access the LAN share located on the computer (it was possible with Windows Mobile) and maybe access the whole network. I own a Galaxy Tab 8.9 and the best would be to find a solution with that tablet.

1	Can you fully remove Google system apps from Android including the Play Store updates?	applications google-play-store 4.3-jelly-bean uninstallation google-apps	Believe it or not, but I want to remove a few Google Apps which I have no use for and want to free up space, resources and mobile data usage by not having them on my phone at all. These include: Google Currents Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Newsstand Google Keyboard Google+ I have uninstalled them via the Play Store, but they still appear in my Installed items in My apps in the Play Store and instead of UPDATE' and UNINSTALL for any other app in my Installed list, they stubbornly remain and only have OPEN AND UPDATE options. Also going in the All list in My Apps, all these apps are also different from other ones, where unlike other locally uninstalled apps that have their payment status (FREE or PURCHASED) and a X at the top to remove it from your Google Account entirely, these Google Apps that I dont want on my Android and want to be completely optional for my Android experience, only have an UPDATE and no X up the top of their listing. I dont mind them remaining on the Google Account if Google insists on this, but I just want listings to update them in my Google Play updates list to be removed, given this is Google basically forcing me to reinstall them against my will. Is there a way to do this? Im on stock 4.3 Gnex. 
1	How do I get my Nexus 7 to show up in the adb devices list?	adb nexus-7 windows usb-drivers	So I have a Nexus 7 that I'm trying to connect to my Windows computer for debugging over adb.

The tablet is not rooted and I have not unlocked the bootloader. The computer is running Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 x64. I have the latest adb version, 1.0.31. The SDK manager tells me I have SDK Tools rev 22.0.1 and SDK Platform-tools rev 17. I've tried using the Google generic usb driver version 7.0.0.1 and 6.0 as well as the Asus usb_driver_r06 from http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=Nexus+7&amp;p=28&amp;s=2 . Each driver I try does show the tablet as connected in device manager as either "Android Composite ADB Interface" or "Android ADB Interface" If I plug the tablet in to my Macbook Pro and run adb devices, I get the the RSA fingerprint dialog as I would have expected to see in Windows: Also if I start the tablet in fastboot by holding down the power and volume down buttons. I can see it with the fastboot utility: C:\android\sdk\platform-tools&gt; .\fastboot devices015d262e32540802 fastboot I am completely out of ideas here.

However, I am trying to play Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Webtiles on my tablet, and it does not bring up the keyboard. Is there any way to bring it up manually? I'm on a Nexus 7, running Jelly Bean. Ideally, there would be something that did not show up on the status bar, but sat in the notification drawer, and I could tap that to bring up the keyboard. Actually, even better would be something that sat down in the bottom, next to the navigation controls, but I don't believe that's possible without modifying the framework.

1	Galaxy S GT-I9000: how to fix boot to recovery with Volume up+Power?	cyanogenmod samsung-galaxy-s boot recovery-mode	I have Samsung Galaxy S (GT-I9000) and I've installed Cyanogenmod 10 M2. I can reboot into recovery from Cyanogenmod (Hold Power button, select Reboot and Recovery). However, I cannot boot directly to recovery holding Volume up + Power or Volume up + Home + Power when the phone is powered down. Do I need to do something to the phone hardware to get some button combination to boot to recovery mode? As far as I know, the button combination I've tried is the correct one for this device. I can boot to download mode with Volume down + Power. The recovery is the one installed along the official galaxysmtd Cyanogenmod 10 M2 ("CWM-based Recovery v6.0.1.4"). I would want to fix the issue because now I'm afraid to flash ROM updates because getting into recovery in case of boot loop is much harder if I cannot get the normal key combo to work. 
1	How do I add a new language?	languages localization	The aftermarket ROM I use seems to have the language list parred down to just a couple selections, probably to save space. I would like to add a language back into the system. I can already set the locale using programs such as MoreLocale 2 so that applications with my language support start with the right locale code, however that doesn't add missing system languages. Having the system in another language would be nice, but the main thing is getting the dictionary files for the keyboard auto-complete . How does one go about adding the language support files for an input language to a system or ROM? I can access other ROM's or the AOSP project to rip things out, but I don't know where to start. What files do I need and what modifications need to be made? Is there an easy way to do this with say a language-pack or is it hackery all the way? My ROM is fully rooted and I have adb access if necessary. It's Android 2.3.7 ( Unofficial CM 7.1 port for Dream/Sapphire ) and I'm using the stock Android keyboard. The language I want is Turkish, although unless somebody has a download to point me to it's mostly the process I'm looking for here.

1	Tablet won't connect to any WiFi network anymore, always shows "saved"	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich wi-fi connection-issues	My tablet will not connect to ANY WiFi network anymore. Everything was working perfectly for about a month. But now, the WiFi icon has disappeared, and every time I try to connect to a network it simply shows "Saved." I figured maybe it was an issue with my network, so I went out and tested it with other WiFi connections. It can scan and detect everything, but the same thing happens while trying to connect to anything. My Nokia phone and laptop are able to connect to everything perfectly, but the tablet will not, even to the networks which it has previously connected to. Things I have tried: Deleted all networks by using the "Forget network" option and tried connecting again. Tried "open" type networks without any passwords. Rebooted the tablet several times. Done a factory reset, twice. Tried to analyse logcat data. Here is a screenshot: I also tried connecting to my laptop using Ad-hoc (with the laptop using a wired ethernet connection and transmitting it to the tablet wirelessly) but no use. As you can see in the screenshot, the WiFi icon which turns blue and gray is GONE from the notification bar. It never shows up anymore. And the "Saved" result is what comes up every time I try to connect to a network. I switched the WiFi on and tried connecting to the network while logcat was running, here is the text: http://pastebin.com/9pUba6Tt The D/CommandListener( 79): Clearing all IP addresses on wlan0 is what happens every time I attempt to connect to any network. Always the same thing. I have gone through dozens of XDA threads and such with this issue. Many people have gotten the "Saved" problem, but it's only been for people who have UPDATED to ICS 4.0.4 from Gingerbread or something. My tablet CAME with ICS 4.0.4. <

1	Flash boot.img without using fastboot USB	rom-flashing recovery-mode boot fastboot	So I've recently rooted my phone and tried a ROM or two. I find it really handy that you can use TWRP recovery to install another ROM from the SD card, you don't need to have it connected to a PC.

Then I must use the command fastboot flash boot boot.img from the folder where boot.img is located. Is it possible to flash this boot image with TWRP or any other way without using fastboot over USB?

So what exactly does that mean? Is that message added to a queue for next batch process to inform server or something else? And during that state (waiting/clock icon next to message) if I delete that message, will that deleted message still be delivered to the recipient? Actually, I mistakenly sent a message to one of my contacts and luckily that time I was not connected to any network. After a few seconds when I realized this, I deleted that message. But I am not sure if it got deleted completely or it will get delivered when I reconnect to any network. I don't want that message to be delivered to the recipient, so I had disabled all networks on my device. 
1	How can I do factory reset on Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tab?	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich factory-reset samsung-galaxy-tab-10	After more evidence of my son breaking into my tablet (darned 11-year-old... going to be a true Social Engineer hacker, if I can't get through his thick head that he'll lose all computer privileges...), I changed the password this morning... and can't remember it now. Unfortunately, after multiple failed password attempts, IT IS NOT ASKING FOR MY GOOGLE LOGIN TO UNLOCK. I don't seem to be able to get to the "failsafe" unlock mechanism any more, and so am looking to do a complete factory reset. I've seen instructions to hold down the Volume-Up + Power buttons to initiate this (remember, I can't log in, so I can't do this from settings.) All that happens is that the tablet goes into a mostly-blank screen showing what is probably a newly-opened box, and a blinking Android that says "Downloading...". I let it sit for close to two hours in this state, and nothing. It did respond to a power-down from here, but just came back up to the password login. What am I doing wrong? (Apart from choosing such a simple password as 10 U/L/num characters... obviously not sufficiently complex...). Brian

I've tried to install the following ROM from xda-developers in a Sanei N10: Unofficial CyanogenMod 10 for many AllWinner A10 tablets I've installed it following the usual procedure: Press Vol+ and Power to get the Recovery menu Select Wipe data/factory reset Select Wipe cache Install the three ZIP files: "cm10_a10_20120913.zip", "gapps-jb-20120726-signed.zip" &amp; "n10_compatibility_1.2.1.zip" The problem is, even though the first ZIP with the ROM installs successfully, the second one (the one with Google's apps) refuses to install, showing instead the message "signature verification failed". The same happens with the third ZIP (N10 compatibility). So the installation doesn't actually finish. If I reboot the tablet, it runs Cyanogenmod 10, but the touchscreen doesn't work (I have to plug a USB mouse to interact with the operating system). So what do I do to avoid the dreaded "signature verification failed" message? Just in case if it's of any help to identify the problem, I'll mention that I can see the Android bot laying down with a red triangle with an exclamation when entering the Recovery menu. I've tried to use the ROM Manager which is preinstalled with Cyanogenmod 10, but when choosing "Flash ClockworkMod Recovery" it says that "The SD Card needs to be mounted to use ROM Manager". Of course my MicroSD is properly mounted (I can see its files in the card from console, from the "Terminal Emulator"). I think this happens because the MicroSD is mounted in /storage/sdcard1 instead of in /storage/sdcard0, but I can't change that. I can't download APKs from the browser, either, because it also says something similar about not being able to access the SD (even though it's correctly mounted and I can see it mounted from Settings >

1	Galaxy S3 stuck on boot loop, Factory Reset didn't work	samsung-galaxy-s-3 boot-loop	My Samsung Galaxy S3 (GT-I9300) was rebooting itself for the past few days, randomly. Today, it did it again, but didn't boot back up. Instead, it is now stuck on an infinite boot loop - it gets as far as the splash screen (Galaxy SIII logo), then reboots, and this goes on forever, until I remove the battery. The first thing I tried was to remove the battery, SIM card and MicroSD card for 5 minutes. I then wiped the Cache Partition through the Android Recovery Mode. I then did an Emergency Firmware Recovery through Samsung Kies. This didn't help - the phone is still on the same boot loop. I then tried a Factory Reset through the Android Recovery Mode. This also didn't help. I tried to view the boot logs through the Android SDK tools, but of course, the phone won't stay on for long enough to connect via USB. I'm not sure what else to try. Is there any other way I could possibly access the device's logs? Or should I try Odin instead of Kies? Update: my S3 was had the official stock firmware on it, with official OTA upgrades, it was never rooted. Second update: I've now tried flashing with Odin3. I used the firmware version appropriate for my region and carrier. Everything was successful, but I'm still having the same problem. I'm guessing there's not much else left to try except bring the device back to the dealer? ... 
1	Turning off cell broadcast messages in Ice Cream Sandwich	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich cell-broadcast	The phone is a stock HTC One X. The settings menu does not include a checkbox to enable/disable CB messages. They just keep popping up. Update : Halfer already gave the link to the wikipedia article about CB, which should explain it in more detail than I ever can. What it means to me is that I get location information as I move around in town. The screenshot here shows the checkbox for this feature on what I believe is Gingerbread: Update 2 : And this is the extremely boring message. This particular one just shows the carrier name, so it's even more useless and annoying than if it were showing location information: 
1	how to fix grey wifi icon (no internet), and how to track what caused that?	wi-fi internet	[SUSPENDED. see P.S. at end, any good way to deal with this suspended state?] My phone have the grey wifi-icon problem, where you do not have access to internet. Yesterday it was working fine, I changed nothing. Usually it always connected grey and a few moments later it gets colored, but now it is forever grey... I followed these tips from other questions that did not work: turn wifi-off/on turn air-plane mode on, wait 1min, turn it off (and wifi on) forget/remove the wifi config and recreate it reboot the phone reboot wireless router shutdown the phone (NO) I got a tip to lower my router security from TKIP+AES to only TKIP, but it was working perfectly yesterday; so I will not do that for obvious reasons.. I can ping my phone from my PC. I can JuiceSSH from my android into PC (intranet is ok). I can do nothing internet related... My phone is not rooted, should I? My connection drops from time to time when I see "obtaining ip address" if I leave it on the wifi config page, but it was like that already before the grey icon problem.. Where I can see wifi log to try to understand what is happening? PS.: my phone is working again, I did nothing either to fix it; my PC was connecting to internet while my phone not... now both are ok; I will keep the question as the problem may happen again and I wasnt able to track what caused and how to fix (if ever possible); just that it is not urgent for now... thx! 
1	Open YouTube's saved offline video (.exo file)	youtube	My question is specific to YouTube app's new offline functionality. I have saved some video from YouTube app on my Android phone. I restored my phone OS due to some problem. But I have files that were downloaded by YouTube app stored on SD Card. Now YouTube is not showing that videos in offline list.

1	How can I watch movies offline on my Android tablet?	video asus-eee-pad-transformer 3.2-honeycomb offline	How can I watch movies on my tablet (Asus Transformer tablet with Android 3.2) offline? I recognize that this is a very basic question, however, I can not find any step-by-step instructions on this site or online. It is also not clear if any popular sites such as Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu support offline viewing. I think that it would be useful to have step-by-step instructions. If I had the tablet in my hands, I would probably be able to figure something out - even though it is a new device and my first experience with Android. However, my wife has taken it and the children on a trip, and would like to use it for entertainment on the flight home.

1	Restoring original 2.2 firmware on Samsung Galaxy Tab GT-P1000L	samsung-galaxy-tab device-firmware	I've originally asked this question on stackoverflow , and I was suggested to ask it here. I'm currently in trouble with my samsung Galaxy Tab GT-P1000L GSM+WiFi model from Brazilian's Vivo carrier. The problem was: Whenever I try to open most apps (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others -- but not all) the Tablet would vibrace once, then twice, then display an error message saying that the "application stopped suddenly" and I'd have to try again. I've noticed that there were a bunch of apps installed and I deleted them all. After reboot, they came back. If I install any new apps, they would work (even Facebook), but after reset, they were all wiped out and replaced with the previous versions (like it was restoring an old "backup" of the system with those apps installed). I've managed to use adb to see the filesystem and deleted the contents of "/sdcard" which was mounted like: /dev/block/vold/179:1 /mnt/sdcard vfat rw,dirsync,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,uid=1000,gid=1015,fmask=0002,dmask=0002,allow_utime=0020,codepage=cp437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro 0 0 /sdcard was a symlink to /mnt/sdcard. Note that there was no sdcard on the device. When one was put, a directory "external_sd" was created inside /mnt/sdcard and the contents of the disc would be there. I've tried to manually delete everything inside /mnt/sdcard but it all came back upon reboot. (Note: I don't have root access to the device.) I've managed to mess things up for good when I tried the command ./fastboot erase recovery . Now the main interface keeps "rebooting" -- it displays the carrier name, then the lock screen, then vibrates once, then twice, then carrier name again... It is running android 2.2 and I'm trying to prep it to give it away (my wife is trading it fo

1	How to fix a force close loop on Android with phone access?	samsung-galaxy-s-2 force-close	I have a problem with my Samsung Galaxy S2 (GT-I9100) running Android 2.3.5 stock version. I'm normal user who used the phone for basic function like making phone calls and using the Google, Facebook apps with some installed apps from the play store. Today, 2 hours ago logsprovider initiated out of nowhere an endless loop of "force close" alerts, between them most of the running apps were closed too (including some weird z7... app). Because of the interval (about half a second) between alerts I can goto settings -> apps -> and "clear data" in the logsprovider config. This stops the "force close" alerts loop until the next restart of the phone. in this state I basically don't have access to the phone features and all the home screens are empty, including the phone's apps menu. I can run any app by adding it to the home screen and then executing it, if the app has system operation like the play store that require it to install something, the app will crash and no new programs will install. I can also connect the phone to a computer and get access to all the files (I think it's just those on storage), I might try to get an apk of an antivirus there and try to install it - hope it doesn't crash These are desperate times... thats why I'm contacting the experts: Can I fix this, this might have been caused by an app, what to do? If the only solution is factory reset how do I backup the data, apps, or contact lists?

On opening Samsung Kies, it is saying that the connected device is locked. Please enter password on the connected device. I can only assume its the pattern lock they are referring to as I have managed to unlock the sim. As I am unable to do this due to the screen being cracked, I wondered whether there is any other way of doing this, before sending the same onto my insurance company, as they are saying that I will lose all the data! Cant see why seeing as its just the hardware that is damaged and not the software.

When I go to the menu in Google Maps and select Make Available Offline, I get the usual square overlay to select the area, and then it turns red and says "Offline maps is not available in selected area". I've tried zooming in and out, and moving the selection area around, but no luck.

1	Simple exit to "downloading don't turn off target " downloading mode	samsung-galaxy-s-3 recovery-mode	As a curious newbie I went into downloading mode in my Samsung Galaxy S3 by pressing Vol down + center Home + power button. After that I got options to press Vol up key to continue and Vol down key to cancel. Out of sheer curiosity and thinking I can exit anytime I pressed Vol up key and the very infamous "downloading do not turn off" screen sits with the green Android logo. All this was done without any cable attached to my computer since I don't want to root or flash my ROM. I just was curious as to what happens next. Now the screen just waited for Odin to connect, however I did not since after connecting I am unsure if there is no direct exit option from Odin without flashing ROM and not doing anything (in other words a simple exit from Odin with no rooting and no flashing and nothing happens). Next I tried to go into recovery mode and tried all combinations of keys to exit this "downloading" mode but I failed. The power naturally went down as I was reading through many help articles and I put in another battery and now the phone doesn't turn on at all now; there is no reaction and it does not go into recovery mode either. Now I am in a soup as I want my photos and messages to be recovered (no external SD storage used) I wish to know: If I do manage to go into recovery mode, then selecting option "reboot system now" will simply reboot my system and phone will work? If this does not work then does recovery mode option, "wipe cache partition" delete all user photos and messages? (I am absolutely sure factory reset option does delete all user data.) If my phone waits on "downloading don't turn off target screen", then how do I simply exit this mode? Should I connect to Odin (highly risky) and exit? (I don't know what will happen.) Does connecting to Odin necessarily mean that I have to flash my ROM? 
1	How much power does a Galaxy Tab 10.1 charger need to supply?	charging samsung-galaxy-tab-10	The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes with a special charger which (I'm assuming) provides a higher current output than the USB standard. Without it, the device can actually die, even if the USB cord is plugged in to a USB port (albeit a little less quickly). I'm looking for other (cheaper) AC and car adapters, but I don't know the minimum power they need to provide to power the device. Does anyone know the minimum current needed for a 5V USB connection for the Galaxy Tab 10.1, or perhaps a link that provides this information? 
1	How can I find out what causes "Android OS" to consume battery?	2.3-gingerbread battery battery-life	The issue is that I see a high percentage on the "Android OS" item in the Battery Usage, and I want to find out what is causing it. But let me say that I'm interested in diagnostics techniques and tools, rather than increasing the battery life, as you will see in the below figures that the battery isn't drained much faster than expected. Here's the situation with the phone right now: Last charged 13 hours ago I restarted the phone after charging it I have switched off everything (such as GPS, WiFi, Data network) I was on a 2G network all the time My only use from the phone during the day was a few minutes of WiFi, receiving two SMS messages, and a call that lasted less than a minute. I have auto-sync turned off And here's the battery usage stat: Android OS: 67% Display: 10% Cell standby: 9% Phone idle: 6% The Android OS shows 1 hour and 30 minutes of CPU time, but the total time that the phone was turned on was less than 30 minutes, and I don't have anything active in the background. The battery level isn't bad at all (80%), but considering that I haven't done anything with the phone (and that the phone has a 2500 mAh battery) I am curious to find out what is causing the battery usage. Obviously, this should be caused by some background tasks that aren't listed in the battery usage. I am looking for ways, tools, and methods that enables me to diagnose this further and relate the 67% of the usage to actual applications. Some additional information: I have a Galaxy Note, with Gingerbread 2.3.6 installed. I have "Usage Timelines Free" installed (which wasn't running during the day), and it doesn't show any excessive CPU usage by any app that can lead me toward who's consuming the battery.

1	How safe is it to use Aptoide?	alternative-markets	As with the latest update to Google Play one now longer sees the full list of permissions requested by an app on install/update 1 , I feel my privacy invaded. Even worse, an app could sneak in additional permissions with an update, and without the user knowing 2,3 . So I'm looking towards alternatives. TL;DR: I know we've got What are the alternative Android app markets? , but a) that's more or less a listing of other markets (without giving backgrounds) 4 , and b) it's not even mentioning Aptoide . I don't want another app that has to run in background permanently to "check license validity", so things like the Amazon Appstore or AndroidPIT are out. AppBrain is just another front-end to Google Play so nice as it is, it doesn't solve the issue, as for app installs and updates it just has to re-direct to Google Play which I'm rather about to "flee". I've already checked out F-Droid a few days ago, and feel it pretty fitting my needs (follow the link for details) but with just about 1.200 Apps (as of 6/2014) it leaves too many gaps. Aptoide on the other end is said to serve more than 120.000 apps currently. As the name suggests, it uses APT style repositories, which I'm used to from Linux (Debian and derivates). It even lets you have your own private repo to share apps between devices (or with friends). All apps are offered for free, so no need for a "license server". But how

1	How to increase internal memory of the HTC Wildfire S finally?	internal-storage app2sd link2sd insufficient-memory htc-wildfire-s	I've been spending a lot of sleepless nights trying to fix this. I know there are a lot of threads like this on the internet, but I want to go a bit deeper. I have an HTC Wildfire S with only 512 MB internal flash memory. This internal memory has a partition layout allocation around 130 MB for the /data partition and around 290 MB for the /system partition. Both of them are full. (In addition I got a 16 GB SD-card.) Installing apps, upgrading apps, running most of the apps - impossible. Now, I knew it's possible to move apps to SD-card, the so called apps2sd procedure which offers very limited functionality to move some of the application data to the SD-card. Anyways after moving every possible data to SD the internal memory was still full and the phone unusable. I was reading about more sustainable methods like data2sd . I gave it a try. I used the instructions from htcdev.com to unlock the bootloader , I installed the latest ClockWorkMod Recovery and rooted the device permanently. Finally, I used the rooted device to install Android 4.1.2 AOKP Jelly Bean Custom ROM and Data2SD like discribed in the linked articles. But I was stuck the device was not booting until I removed Data2SD. The AOKP-ROM was working pretty well and stable, but installing Data2SD simply did not work in combination with Jelly Bean (SD-card formatting: 11 GB FAT23, 4GB e

I broke the screen a few days back and it was locked at the time. The phone is working because it can charge and I can hear the alarm and incoming calls and messages but I can't see a thing because it is all black. I can't possibly unlock the phone because the touch is not working too. I need to retrieve my files from the phone. So when I connect my phone using a USB to my MAC, it shows me absolutely nothing except this error: If your device's screen is locked, disconnect its USB cable, unlock your screen, and then reconnect the USB cable. Like I said, I cannot unlock the screen. I can't use Samsung's Find my Phone application because I never added a Samsung Account to it and so my device is not registered for remote data recovery. When I connect my phone to my HP laptop via USB, it shows nothing, not even an error. Is there any way I can unlock my phone remotely and retrieve my files? 
1	How do I remove an incorrect word from autocorrect?	keyboard 4.4-kitkat auto-correct dictionary	To begin with, I've tried in futility to search everywhere else on the internet to fix this, so I'm asking here now. I have a Nexus 4 running Android 4.4. Sometime within the past year, DONT started appearing as a word in my autocorrect options. IIRC, it began appearing immediately after an OS upgrade (I'm thinking the 4.3 release). Screenshot: I do not have DONT in any user dictionaries on the device. I have exhaustively searched all user-level language/dictionary settings and cannot find this anywhere. It's really annoying because it takes over the default correction of don't , so I just end up looking stupid. (Here is my personal dictionary listing [one item redacted]): If DONT were here it would be between Catan and Dropbox Is there some other/hidden location where dictionary/replacement text gets stored? And/or does anybody have another suggestion for how to get this stupid word removed from my device?

I tried to change the screen lock PIN, but the settings app wouldn't accept my PIN. Later, the screen locked due to the timeout being reached, and I wasn't able to unlock it. My password kept being rejected, and the "Forgot password" button that I read should come up never appeared. I rebooted my phone, and though I can easily decrypt it, I can't unlock it. This answer suggested going through adb to fiddle with an SQLite database. However, I can't seem to access /data on my phone. I get the following error when I try to do an ls : opendir failed, Permission denied I tried to use su , but again, I got a Permission denied error. The phone is most definitely rooted, as I regularly use several root-only apps. I really don't want to have to wipe the phone. Is there any other way to unlock this phone? Edit After posting this question, I came across this answer . I was able to get my phone unlocked by exploiting the phone hole mentioned (involving calling the phone and mashing the keys repeatedly--though instead of hitting the non-existent home key I swiped up Google Now). I deleted the password using the SQL mentioned in the answer I cited earlier. However, upon rebooting the p

1	Text message with pictures: "Download" button does nothing	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich samsung-galaxy-s-2 sms mms	I have a Galaxy S2 running Android 4.0.4. When people send me text messages with a picture attached, I receive the message but it says something like this, with a "download" button: Message size: 1KBExpires: 8:52AM, Mar 12[Download] When I press the download button, it changes to the text "Downloading" for a moment, and then it changes back to the download button and nothing else happens. I was expecting the picture to open, or something. Is there some way I can download &amp; view these pictures? [Update]: I have seen other suggestions to turn on mobile data. I went to: Applications =&gt; Settings =&gt; Data Usage and verified that Mobile data = ON. As an experiment, I toggled it OFF then ON again, then pushed the Download button on my text message again, but got the same result (it said "downloading" briefly then nothing). I have also turned off auto-retrieve here: Messaging app =&gt; Menu =&gt; Settings =&gt; Multimedia message (MMS) settings Auto-retrieve is unchecked &amp; still no success. I'm pretty stumped. Update #2:Suggestion to check APN settings. I went to: Settings =&gt; Wireless &amp; network But there is no "mobile" choice. There is a "more => mobile networks" but it only has "3G data" and "connections optimizer". Is there some other way to find/set the APN settings?

1	Is there a way to download the files stored on Google Drive to an Android device?	google-drive	I've stored some images in Google Drive, and I'd like to view them on my tablet. The problem is, I can only view them one at a time and the procedure goes something like this: Open Drive. Navigate to image folder. Select image to view. View image. Press back. Select another image to view (while trying to remember which image I just viewed, so I don't view it again). Repeat steps 3 - 6. If I could download the files onto the tablet, I could view them in the default image viewing application and the procedure is more like this: Select image to view. Slide left/right to view next/previous image. Is there a way to download the files stored on Google Drive to an Android device? Update: I found a slightly awkward workaround. If you login to Google Drive using a web browser, clicking on the image will download it to /storage/sdcard0/Download/ . You can then view the images using the default image viewer application. 
1	Confused by the many locations of the virtual /sdcard/	internal-storage nexus-4 storage internal-sd	Some devices (like my Nexus 4) don't have an external slot for an SD Card. Instead, there's a root folder called /sdcard/ that is treated the same way. But I also find other paths that all point to the same files -- there must be some kind redirects going on (I think this is called symlinks in Linux). All these paths contain the same files: /sdcard//storage/sdcard0//storage/emulated/0//storage/emulated/legacy/ Which path is the "actual" one? What about the other paths? What are they used for, why do they exist?

1	Can't install Google Play Services	google-play-store 2.2-froyo google-plus htc-mytouch	I just upgraded Google+ to 3.6.0.44338848 (released late March 2012) and now it won't launch. It says: This app won't run without Google Play services, which are missing from your phone. If I tap "Get Google Play services" I'm brought to Google Play where I tap "install" and "accept and download" but then I get "Error: No connection." (I do have a connection. I can browse the web just fine.) Now, I should mention that Market/Play has been odd the whole time, I've had this phone, a T-Mobile myTouch 4G running Android 2.2.1. Whenever I want to install an app, I have to go into Applications, tap Google Play Store, and tap "Uninstall updates" to restore the Market app. Then I can install applications. Over time, some process upgrades Market to Google Play but I can't install applications until I downgrade to Market to avoid the "Error: no connection" message. The processes is frustrating. On my old LG phone (also running 2.2 Google Play worked just fine). I'm been putting up with all this downgrading because it's not often I install apps and usually there's no problem after installing or upgrading an app. But now the Google+ app is unusable so I'm motivated to do something about the "No connection" problem. I've read through posts such as http://www.teamandroid.com/2013/01/14/fix-google-play-store-no-connection-retry-error-message/ and Google's help page at How to access the Google Play Store app - Google Play Help but I'm stuck. Please help.

However, I believe modern electronics should be able to handle this kind of scenario and automatically stop charging the battery once it's full. Does this apply to modern Android phones? Or do I need to continue disconnecting it all the time?

1	Is this red star icon malware? How to get rid of it?	malware airpush	Every now and then a red star icon appears on my brother's notification bar, as shown below. The message related to this notification is some advert like "Turbo Boost Your Battery". He has been installing software from doubtful places, so my guess it is some sort of malware he accidentally installed. I'm not very familiar with Android, but my guess was to identify the process responsible for the notification. So I checked the process list, but nothing out of the ordinary was shown. I tried force-closing all processes (some returned although all of them originated from HTC or his carrier), but nothing made the star disappear. How can the malware be detected and removed?

The process com.android.phone has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again." And I cannot even go the browser or Task Killer because every time I do, it will force quit. How can I reinstall those apps? I think I cleared all data for those but I did not clear the browser and so why can't I open the browser? Do I really need to send it for repair or can I fix it?

1	How to force 2G/3G/4G?	4.4-kitkat moto-x	I recently moved from Note 2 to Moto X. In Note 2, the 'Mobile Networks' page inside Settings had the 'Network Mode' setting with options: GSM/WCDMA (Auto mode), GSM only or WCDMA only . In Moto X however, instead of 'Network Mode' there is 'Prefered network type' which has the options: 4G (recommended), 3G or 2G . Through this I can force 2G, I'm assuming, but not 3G or 4G (there's no 4G in India yet anyway). Is there any other setting or any app that can force only 3G (or 4G)?

I'm clicking around to verify that it won't appear and the solution at this time seems to be that rebooting the phone will do it and I might not have to uninstall the search update which was mentioned. 
1	Battery getting very hot and draining unusually quickly on the S2, S3, and now the S4?	samsung-galaxy-s	This is a pretty unusual problem, and I've encountered the question in various forums but never the answer. I've had this problem on and off since the Galaxy SII. What happens is I'll take the phone off the charger in the morning, and it will be extremely hot in my pocket all day, then it will die about 10 hours later. This is an intermittent problem. I thought it was loosely associated with the alarm clock, but I got a new phone yesterday because the SIII died a few months ago, and I have not had this phone for more than 24 hours and already it has the same problem. I haven't installed anything on it, and I've barely used any data. I have a 200 mb plan, so I can't even use data that often. The only other weird thing that's persisted is that the red arrow on the wifi and on mobile data seems to always be lit when I turn on the phone. Has anyone seen this problem or know how to fix it?

On my Google Maps feature under my Location History it shows a location that I was never at at any point, but when my wife happened to see that location she doesn't believe me that the GPS could be wrong and pinpoint that location if I was never there. I was first wondering myself how could that could be possible if I was never there or my phone was never at that location that was 35 miles away from me and second is there any way I could prove the GPS being wrong? Can I contact Google Maps and can they give an official printout of that certain day and every location I was? I really need to prove my honesty to her and hope there is a way.

The Google Maps app does not store maps reliably, so it is risky to rely on it without an Internet connection.

1	How to recover data from a damaged SD card?	external-sd data-recovery	I have an HTC Inspire. I have had my 8 GB SD Card for three years...needless to say, it has like 5000 pictures and hundreds of videos on it. It has a lot of music on it too, but I'm not worried about that. I just want my pictures back more than anything. I got a message on my phone that told me I should safely unmount my SD card before removing it. Since I haven't taken it out for months, I didn't think anything of it. A few hours later, it said "SD Card damaged. You may have to reformat it." When I clicked on that, it said "Are you sure you want to format the Sd card? All data on your card will be lost." I have tried plugging it into the computer, but there's not an option to view files. I tried putting it in my dad's phone, and his phone didn't even recognize that it was even in there. If anyone has ANY ideas, whatsoever, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!! 
1	How can I use my Galaxy Nexus as an external USB storage drive?	samsung-galaxy-nexus file-transfer usb-mass-storage	I just got the Galaxy Nexus and learned that it does not support USB Mass Storage mode. It only supports MTP and PTP. I regularly use my phone as a USB flash drive at work so this is a problem. I can transfer files back and forth with MTP however I need to edit files directly on my phone . I'd like to find a way to continue to use the phone as an external drive and be able to access the files on my phones storage directly without transferring the files back and forth however I have several constraints: The network at my work isn't connected to the internet, it doesn't have wifi, and the computers do not have Bluetooth and this is not going to change. Ideally I would not have to install anything on the computer, but if there are no other options I'd consider this. Are there any hacks or workarounds that will allow me to use my Galaxy Nexus as an external flash drive in the way I described? Can I create a separate mountable FAT partition on the phones storage that I can access from a Windows XP computer a well as through the Android OS in the way that's possible with other devices that have external storage cards? The Phone: It's a rooted &amp; unlocked Galaxy Nexus on VZW and currently running CM9. 
1	Why doesn't my Samsung Galaxy S communicate via USB?	samsung-galaxy-s usb usb-connection-mode	I discovered today that I cannot connect my PC with Samsung GT-I9000 any more: when I plug in the microUSB cable, nothing happens other than that the phone starts to charge. Earlier I got to see Connect to Kies or something like that. Things I've tried so far: -Switcing USB debugging on and off -Removing battery -Trying different cable -Trying reimaging PC to a known good state (where I previously would have found new hardware) -Trying different computer -Factory data reset -Formatting internal SD card -Entering download mode with mUSB jig (my phone has download and recovery modes disabled otherwise) and reconnecting mUSB cable. Then I saw the "USB Device Not Recognized. One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned..." error on Windows (XP). Is there anything else I could try before sending it to the long journey of Warrantyland? UPDATE:I tried an app z4root which rooted the phone without the need of usb cable, then I could use Rom Manager to force the phone into Recovery Mode (remember my phone had the 3-button combo disabled). There I deleted-erased-formated everything I could and when I got back to normal mode and tried connecting again, Windows found new hardware and Kies recognized the phone. Just to be sure, I pulled the cable from computer, waited for 2 secs and then reconnected but, alas, nothing happenend again. I reimaged the PC and redid the z4root+Rom Manager+Recovery Mode wipe thing but nothing. Then I tried to reinsert microusb plug into phone under an angle and witnessed a successful connection. Kies offered updating firmare. I did not breathe on the phone and carefully clicked mouse to accept in hope that if this was a software error, new update would fix it. The update went fine but after the phone rebooted and I could confirm the firmware version from About, I still could not connect. Then I used USB jig which I purchased from eBay to force the phone into download mode and

1	Why can I not access the cyanogenmod zip on my sd card?	rooting samsung-galaxy-s unbricking	All right, I have fouled up my Galaxy S while trying to install Cyanogenmod after rooting with Odin. I now have the clockworkMod Recovery 2.5.1.0 and I am trying to select the cyanogen Update .zip from my SD card. Neither option Apply sdcard:update.zip and install zip from sdcard work Apply sdcard:update.zip simply yield this message: E: Can't open /mnt/sdcard/update.zip. No such file or directory. Installation aborted. Mind that I have already renamed the Cyanogen file to update.zip install zip from sdcard does not show the sd directory. The Update.zip is nowhere to be found. Steps taken so far: I have already wiped all the caches (Dalvik and otherwise) and reset. This guy's solution did not help either: Why is CyanogenMod zip not being found when I try to install it? I wanted to copy the zip directly to the internal storage ( according to this tutorial ), but I don't have access to it anymore. When I connect the phone to my computer, it is does not pop up as an external drive. Other possibly relevant information: After the root, there was a boot loop, which I ignored. Shoot me, but there is no backup Edit : My firmware was XWJW5, Version 2.3.6 Question: Is there any way I can still access the cyanogenmod file - or any other file - on my SD card? Can my Galaxy S be saved somehow? Among the myriad of options to root your device out there, which one could help me? 
1	What is the mysterious "CDC Serial" device and why do I needed it?	4.2-jelly-bean samsung-galaxy-s-4	I've built my own PC computer from parts I purchased online, I did a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit with SP1 (full version, no OEM bloatware), and I ran Windows Update several times to get the latest and greatest updates from Microsoft. I was pleased to see that everything worked as expected, no issues whatsoever, not in software nor in hardware. Next, I connected my brand new Samsung Galaxy S4 Plus (GT-I9506) phone to a free USB port on the computer. Windows detected following 3 different devices. USB Composite Device Galaxy S4 (sg) CDC Serial Windows automatically installed and configured the first two devices (see screenshot above). Except the "CDC Serial" device. It didn't install that one. What is "CDC Serial" device? Why do I need it? How do I install it? The very first thing I did was to check the user's manual (the complete manual, not the getting started guide). There is not a single reference to "CDC Serial". I'm not an expert, but I do understand some of this. The "USB Composite Device" is installed so that Windows can communicate with the phone over the USB cable. The "Galaxy S4 (sg)" is the name I gave to my phone during setup, and this is the device that presents itself to Windows as a media player, makes use of the MTP protocol, and this is what shows up in Windows Explorer. How am I supposed to know what "CDC Serial" is if it's not described in the user's manual? I have never seen that before on any Android device when connected to a PC. I did a search for "cdc serial" on Google and all I could find was people doing some hacks to their phones, like rooting, changing ROM, and generally just hacking it. So what if I don't want to do any of that? Is it still important to configure the "CDC Serial" device? How does it impact the functionality of the phone, e.g. when syncing data between the

1	Callers cannot hear me unless I turn on speaker phone!	samsung-galaxy-s-2 calls audio microphone	I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 (SGH-S959G) and it is a Straight Talk phone (don't know if that makes a difference or not). Anyway, I have only had this phone for about 6 or 7 months. Around August 16, 2013 I noticed that when someone calls me or I call someone I can hear them but they cannot hear me unless I turn on speaker phone. I got in touch with Straight Talk and the representative instructed me to: turn the phone off, take the battery out, take the SIM card out, clean the SIM card by wiping it on my shirt or whatnot, and then replace the SIM and battery. He then said to make a call, which I did and it worked. However, two days later it started back doing the same thing by repeated the instructions listed above in the exact same manner several times and it did not work. It still does not work. Also, when I call voicemail and change my personal settings, it will record what I say without it being on speaker. So I'm not quite sure why I am able to be heard in that manner but not when talking to someone. Also, every now and then when I sit my phone down on a counter, the phone will just randomly turn off. There really is no good reason for that to happen unless I was throwing it down, which I am not. I have always taken good care of my things, especially my $350 phone. It's ridiculous to pay this much and only be able to use it for 6 or 7 months. Please Help. 
1	Is there a way to disable the default calendar app on a Samsung Galaxy S4?	calendar samsung-galaxy-s-4	I'd like to use the standard Google Calendar app (as available in the Play Store) too keep track of events. However, Samsung includes a modified version of the calendar on the S4. In previous iterations of the Galaxy it was possible to disable the Samsung version of the Calendar app so that I wouldn't get duplicate notifications of events. On the S4, it does not seem possible to disable the app or it's notifications (the "disable" button and "show notifications" checkbox are greyed-out in the app info screen). Is there some other trick I can use to disable the Samsung Calendar app?

The description beneath the checkbox merely states "Enable enhanced privacy mode": The screenshot is from Deck's ICS pre-beta, but I'm fairly positive I saw this in CM7 as well because it seems very familiar. I've also seen this settings on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus running both ICS (stock and CM9) and Jelly Bean. Both phones I've seen this on were CDMA devices - an HTC EVO on Sprint, and a Verizon Galaxy Nexus. What little information I've been able to dig up seems to suggest that it may be unique to CDMA, but I cannot say that for certain. What does this setting do? Some theories I've found on forums have included reducing the earpiece volume (so others can't overhear your conversation, I suppose?) and adding extra encryption to the CDMA connection, but I haven't found anything definitive.

I have tried following the advice at How can I turn off Notification Sounds and leave phone sounds on but the answers don't work. There's no separate slider for notifications, and the AudioManager app doesn't shut off vibrations. I have tried the official Google answer but there's no setting, Vibrate -> Never , and setting notifications to silent does not stop the vibrations. I've tried the individual app settings, too, but there's no setting for vibration in the official twitter app, for example. I can stop specific apps from sending any notifications at all, but that's not what I want. I want the notifications to show up in the drop-down, I just don't want any sounds or vibrations.

1	What can cause "Android OS" process to use high percentage of battery?	battery	I've read a bunch of forum posts about the Android OS battery drain bug. This is where the 'Android OS' process is showing large percentages in the battery statistics. For me, I'm running 2.3 Gingerbread. I don't use bluetooth or GPS. I'm on 2G most of the time. Some days I get 40 hours out of a battery. On these days in the battery usage settings, the 'Android OS' process uses about 3% of battery. However other days I get about 8 hours with similar use. On these days the 'Android OS' process uses about 35% of the battery. I really want to find out what causes this. The fixes suggested so far are: Reboot (Temporary). Turn off and remove battery for a couple of minutes. Reset battery stats. Change WIFI sleep policy. Use a task manager Flash stuff to the phone. Revert to older versions of the OS (not really a fix). Does anyone know the definitive cause of this problem and the correct fix? Or is it possible there are multiple issues that cause this so different things will work for different people?

1	Change MTP/PTP for a Galaxy S4 w/ a Broken Screen	usb-connection-mode mtp broken-screen	I'm trying to do a complete backup of all data on my Samsung Galaxy S4 before I send it in for repairs. Even though the screen is completely black and does not work (very little touch abilities), I have the Galaxy Smart Dock, which lets me output the screen via HDMI and control the phone with a mouse. I removed the lock screen, installed Kies, then connected the phone to my computer. Unfortunately, at one point, my phone switched from MTP to PTP, and now I cannot switch back to MTP (which Kies requires). Everything online says to just connect the phone to the computer and swipe down to select the connection mode - I cannot do that because the screen is broken. I also do not see any "three dot" option in Settings / Storage to change the USB Computer Connection. Is there an option I'm missing? Am I SOL? Again, I have full control of my device through the media dock, I just do not have that control when the phone is connected (via USB) to my computer. 
1	Serious battery drain (Screen, Android OS) after JB upgrade	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich samsung-galaxy-s-2 4.1-jelly-bean battery battery-life	Since I upgraded my Samsung Galaxy SII from Android 4.0.4 (ICS) to 4.1.2 (JB), my battery life has decreased dramtically. Running ICS I could easily have ~25% battery left when going to bed, after about 20 hours of moderate use. That is with a few phone calls, reading work/private e-mails as they arrive, occasional news reading, internet browsing and Facebook. My usage pattern is largely unchanged, but since the moment I upgraded to Jelly Bean, I can barely make it through a working day without charging. Looking at earlier battery stat screenshots (I'm a nerd, guilty as charged), my phone would use about 2-3,3%/hour. Now I see usage of between 5,7% and 10,6% per hour! The top power consumer is, as always, the screen, which takes up 35-45% of the power used - just like before. Only now, it has drained the same amount of power, 2-4 times faster - or about 1% of the total battery capacity each minute it's been on. (click images to enlarge) 72% of the total capacity used, of which screen consumed 38% (relative) or 27% (absolute) Android OS has moved up the list of power consumers. Now using typically 16-17% (relative) or 12-17% (absolute), as opposed to the previous 9% (relative) or 5% (absolute). I never switch off WiFi completely, unlike GPS which is switched off (thanks, Facebook) unless I actively need it. Display is set to auto-brightness - just like before. I have completely drained, then fully re-charged, the battery at least three times, to re-calibrate

Numerous forums around the web site apps such as Snapchat and a Yahoo video app as the issues, but I've never installed these apps before. Restarting the phone does seem to fix the issue, but after awhile (more than 12h) later, the battery starts draining again. UPDATE : Like the top answer says, this problem should have been fixed by the 4.4.4 Kitkat update that rolled out.

The phone is connected to the Internet and I also get messages from contacts who have messaged me but I cannot get past the initializing screen whatsoever. Wrote to the WhatsApp team and their robot (I guess) replied saying try connecting to WiFi or reinstall or reboot and stuff. I already tried everything! Restarted,Formatted, Connected to WiFi, Edge, 3g... everything! It actually started and I had to uninstall it because I suddenly got a message in the afternoon saying my backup file was corrupted. And after that nothing is happening!!!! What should I do now? The WhatsApp management is as it is lousy and useless. I had written to them earlier too once but they never reply! What do I do? I use a Micromax a52 Android 2.3.6 phone EDIT Whatsapp status has tweeted that there is some problem and the system is down and that they are working on it.... I had mailed them 4 times and also gave them some screenshots and also the link to this page and also tweeted to whatsapp about the problem...so it seems the problem has been concidered and is being worked uppon! lets wait and see now

1	Something is secretly eating up my Acer Iconia A500 internal memory and I need help finding it	internal-storage insufficient-memory acer-iconia-a500	I've been a happy owner of an Acer Iconia A500 for a bit over a year now but a couple of weeks ago it started to complain about its internal memory being full. I was a bit surprised as I keep movies, and such on the external SD card but I assumed is was some browser cache, Maps or so which had eaten up a fair chunk of the 32G memory it has internally. However, that doesn't seem to be the case. I have cleared the data of almost every single App I have installed but still if I look at the Storage tab of the settings I see the following (a couple of hours ago): I get the feeling that the rightmost grey part of the bar should be a bit more than 379MB... (SD Card at the bottom of the picture is the external one, never mind that one). I've tried almost every disk usage app available out there and they all show similar results, the following is DiskView (picture taken after I removed a few apps): (in this picture "SD Card" is the internal one...) One thing all the disk usage apps seems to have in common is that unless the device is rooted, they cannot see what is in some directories (like /data) which makes me think it is either Android itself (4.0.3 on this device) which has some kind of cache which is misbehaving or that some process is producing extreme amounts of logs somewhere. Sorry for this long intro, but the basic question is: How do I proceed? I guess one alternative is to find what is worth backing up and do a factory reset or something but I wold really like to find out what happened first. Rooting it is an alternative which would probably help me find out more but I sort of like it as it is (except for this issue). If it is needed to resolve it I could of course do it but it feels like you shouldn't have to with an appliance like this.

1	Confusion about photo-backups Android 4.4	backup photos 4.4-kitkat	I have a Nexus 5 with Android 4.4.2, but I am confused as to where photos get backed up. First of all, in the Photos app (which is actually part of Google+), there is an option to set up Auto Backup. Now, in the settings under your Google-account syncing there is also an option to sync Google+ Photos. What is the difference? Also, where are the photos stored? If you delete a photo from inside Photos or inside Gallery on my phone, does it get deleted from both places, from the web (if backed up), ...? Also, what is the difference between the Gallery-app and the Photos-app? Edit: Doing some tests with the auto-backup feature inside Photos , I've concluded:If you take a photo on your device and force auto-backup, it's available online as well. Removing it on your device keeps the picture online, and it is not shown in the Trash . Removing it online however DOES make it show up in the Trash , both online and on your device. Deleting an auto-backuped picture online puts it in the Trash as well, ths making the image available twice on your device (in the Camera and Trash ). Deleting it from the Trash still keeps the image in the Camera . Backing up the library does not upload that image again online, and the Cloud-icon remains. Of course once you think you know the system it gets more complicated. Using Hangouts also puts those images inside a separate folder online, and for some reason some pictures only show up there and NOT inside the Auto-Backup folder. Perhaps because I've been messing around trying to figure thing out, I'll keep better note and force auto-backup in the future. I guess it could be me, but this system is VERY complicated for a user. The cloud-icon would suggest to me that it's available online, but it's still there even after deleting the image online. Of course deleting it online means you don't want it.Also it's not real

I checked the flag under Settings->Location &amp; Security->Data encryption->Storage encryption and now I can't read new files of these types (e.g., .jpg and .txt files). I tried unchecking the box -- a message appeared saying that future files will be decrypted, but existing files will remain encrypted. How do I access the files that are currently encrypted and/or decrypt them?

1	Android Tablet Stuck at Boot Screen	boot-loop	I am new to this forum. I just wanted to seek your help. I have a tablet which is working fine a few days. But one day when I started the tablet its got stuck at android screen. 10-20 and even 30 minutes it remains there and then goes off. Please help me.I also want to include that the tablet is a Chinese one and it is NOT Rooted. Edit: It is a Chinese tablet so there is no brand name written on it. Only thing is that its model no is X5. Hope this helps. 
1	Do I have to charge my phone before I use it the first time?	battery battery-life charging	When I got my last phone, a SE k850i, I was recommended to charge it fully once before I even turned it on.

1	How can I calibrate the compass on my phone?	compass	Google Maps sometimes asks me to calibrate my compass.

How can I calibrate the compass on my phone? 
1	Control Android with broken screen from PC	adb 4.2-jelly-bean samsung-galaxy-nexus broken-screen	My rooted Galaxy Nexus has a broken screen. How can I use my PC (ie, via ADB) to control the phone? androidscreencast would be the ideal solution, but its keyboard/mouse control feature does not work in Jelly Bean. Perhaps someone knows why and we can patch the code? (see: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/androidscreencast/BAeW5iG55FI/ebTFodV-BZsJ ) Installing a VNC server is another, but for the love of me I can't get it to work. Eg, using Droid VNC Server, I install the apk, and am supposed to execute /data/data/org.onaips.vnc/files/androidvncserver but there is no files directory inside org.onaips.vnc (instructions from here: https://github.com/oNaiPs/droid-VNC-server/issues/14 ). VMLite is another VNC server that can be started with a special Windows utility (and doesn't need root!) but it's not OSS so I can't get the apk in order to install (Google Play is not pushing apps to my phone prob because I disabled some service--let me know if I can force Google Play to update itself from ADB or install the app). fastdroid-vnc is a binary (not apk) and it runs fine via shell, but something is broken and it shows nothing. What are my options? Let's make this a community wiki, to help anyone who's broken their screen!

1	Cannot install Whatsapp - it says insufficient storage available	whatsapp-messenger insufficient-memory	I just got a new android phone running 4.4.2 as an interim before I buy another phone. After factory reset, I tried to install Whatsapp. This was the first app that I tried to install and it failed after downloading saying that there was insufficient storage available. I tried doing it multiple times - to the same result. Free internal memory - 1.1GB. Free phone storage memory - 1.3 GB. No other app apart from the inbuilt apps have been installed. Post this, I installed Facebook Messenger and it works just fine. I don't understand why Whatsapp isn't installing. Another messaging service called Hike Messenger also works fine. Please help! Just tried installing "Advanced Task Manager" and "Advanced Task Killer" to the same result - insufficient storage memory. 
1	Why can the Nexus 7 display so much more content on-screen than the Galaxy Nexus?	hardware screen nexus-7	The Galaxy Nexus is 1280x720, and the Nexus 7 tablet is 1280x800. I realize that the tablet is physically larger, but it's screen resolution, not display size, that determines screen real-estate. Why is it that the Nexus 7 appears to be able to show so much more content on-screen? EDIT - My question isn't "why was it designed this way". My question is more "how is it that it is able to show more on the screen"? PPI doesn't explain this. Is it just a matter of the scaling? 
1	Allow only specific apps to use cell data, only when on 3G	data-connection 3g automation tasker firewall	I use Tasker to sync every 30 mins when on 3G. I'm on a limited data plan, and the only apps I use constantly are browser, a Twitter app (Echofon) and Whatsapp. Is there a way to allow only these apps when on cell data, and allow access to all on wifi, either with Tasker or otherwise? I've seen similar questions here, but they're mostly outdated (pre ICS) and/or involve restricting access using DroidWall, which does not differentiate wifi and 3G. 
1	THL W3 with v4.0.4 - periodically getting "Restricted Access Changed" and losing all SIM services	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich data-connection 3g sim-card	What happens exactly: when I use my SIM's data connection, after 1-5 minutes of operation (be it while the phone is active or locked), I get a notification "Restricted Access Changed", losing all SIM services -- voice and data. And I get prompted for my PIN. This only happens when I use the SIM's data connection. Using my home router's Wi-fi never introduces this problem. I had this out of the blue since several weeks ago. I didn't drop or hurt my phone in any way. I tried using SIM cards of 2 of my friends on my phone. They never had problems on their phones (their Android versions are more recent than mine, just pointing that out). Again, after 1-5 mins of idle/active operation on my phone, we get presented with the same error message and PIN input dialog. I tried these: Reset to factory settings -- no apps, nothing. Only started Play Store and locked the phone. Just a minute later, boom, the same problem. Removed my SD card. No change. Tried putting the SIM more firmly in the slot (used some paper to make it fit tighter). No change. Though, I only tried that once and not very stubbornly. I guess I'll try that again in the meantime. In my mobile network, I only have the options of "GSM / WCDMA (auto)" and "WCDMA only". Using either of both doesn't change anything. Switching off 3G seems to "fix" this, which is of course no fix at all since the network gets at least 3 times slower. Not to mention I can't view any video, etc. I can't count that as a solution. Here are few links from my google hunt: Restricted access changed (XDA-Developers) Unlocked Chinese Android/Restricted Access Changed (Howard Forums)

1	Why is my Galaxy S4 still not appearing as a device in Mac OS X	adb samsung-galaxy-s-4 mac-os-x	I am trying to solve the problem of having an empty list of devices when running adb devices . Why is it not appearing? I have tried the following to no avail: Installed Kies and ran Tools > Install driver; then restarted Turned off the Mac OS X firewall in run sudo adb devices instead of just adb devices Read the user manual from Samsung, which simply refers me to use Kies Attach S4 to a different macbook in case the USB input is faulty Try both different USB inputs in my Macbook Pro The output I see after doing a fresh restart and plugging in the S4: ./adb devices* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 ** daemon started successfully *List of devices attached (with nothing more shown underneath) Also, even after installing the drivers using Kies, the device does not appear there. I am running OS X 10.9 on a Macbook Pro. The phone lights up and does start to charge when it is plugged in to any of the 2 USB ports on my Macbook. What else can I try to have my brand new S4 appear in this device list? EDIT It seems according to this thread ( http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s4/282817-pc-cant-detect-galaxy-s4.html ) that it may just be a faulty cable. I'm currently using the cable that came with the S4. I'll try other cables. 
1	How to remove parental control on Amazon Kindle	amazon-kindle-fire parental-control	I have an Amazon Kindle Fire HD with parental control, but I have forgotten the code. How can I remove it without losing anything? I think it involves some kind of "reset", but I want to be sure I won't lose something from the device before I start and that I wont have to spend a lot of time re-sending stuff to it. I see something about de-registering, so perhaps it is not so difficult, though when I try to do it, parental control is blocking me, also it is blocking me from connecting to the Internet with Wi-Fi. 
1	LG G2 - Debugging mode not enabled	usb-debugging	I'm attempting to run an app on the LG G2 (Verizon) using Eclipse on a Mac. The phone, however, is not recognized by the computer. I enabled debugging but it doesn't appear when I do adb devices . Additionally, I never receive the debugging notification when I put the phone in debugging mode. I think it's the phone since I've ran other devices on the mac with no problems. Any suggestions on why the debugging mode is not being enabled? 
1	How do I mount my Samsung galaxy s4 on ubuntu?	usb-connection-mode samsung-galaxy-s-4 mount	I'm running ubuntu 12.04 and have a rooted samsung galaxy s4. The s4 is still 2 software versions back since I need to unroot to update and just havent had the time or energy to do all of the work to get back to where I'm setup. I think it is 4.2.something. So when I plug my S4 into ubuntu via usb I get an error message "Unable to mount SAMSUNG_AndroidError initializing camera:-60: could not lock the device" With my rooted kindle I run gMTP and that gets me access so I tried it with the S4 and it says nothing is available to connect. With my old evo I had no trouble. Even when it wasn't rooted I had access to the sd card just like any other drive being mounted. What's the deal with this s4? I do have usb debugging enabled.

1	Space problem in Samsung Galaxy Pocket GT-S5300	internal-storage	I've seen many questions on this site asking about the famous space problems in Android phones. None of those I've seen helped me and since none of them asked about my phone, I'd like to present a new case. I have three memories, and this is a table showing the usage: What's most bothering is how an advanced phone like this would have such basic problems. I've tried: setting the default installing path to the SD card: No such setting . moving apps to the SD Card using apps like App2SD: Some cannot be moved . I really don't know what else to do. Am I really forced to delete apps? I don't want to delete any of those I've installed (they are 14), why should I do that with over 9 GB of free space available ? I'm just hoping there's an option I missed.

Is there a way I can route the tracker to a specific location when I want so that I could just tell them I am at that location even when I'm not? I'm 17 and I'm getting sick of getting a phone call every time I leave a friend's house. I am willing to root my device and install any kernel or ROM; whatever it takes.

It's the smallest white HTC on the market and it has 'with HTC sense' on the back.

1	Adjusting between Group & Single text messaging on Galaxy S4	sms samsung-galaxy-s-4 mms	I recently got the Samsung S4 on AT&amp;T. I used to have the Motorola Razr M on Verizon. On my Razr M I was able to switch between group text and individual text messages at the time of sending. So if my main setting on my Motorola was to send individual text messages, I was still able to receive group messages as a group and the default was to respond individually, but I had the option to respond as a group also. Does that make sense? Example 1: I could send a picture to 10 people but those 10 people would think they were the only people who got the text message. Example 2: If I receive a group text message that someone wanted 10 of us to get and we all need to be able to respond for a work project we were able to with the Motorola. With my Samsung if I disable MMS then I am only able to see who sent me the message but not everyone who was included so I am not able to respond all. Example 3: If I needed to send a group text message and have it sent as a group I was able to adjust at the time of sending by clicking on group instead of individual and all the people who received the message would see who was included on the text. Even if the main text message default setting was individual. 
1	How to factory reset without data loss and undue pain?	backup factory-reset restore	I ran into a serious SMS bug, which knowledgeable users seem to be saying means the SMS message database is corrupt ( source 1 , source 2 ). This is consistent with my current experience. In my case I lost all ~1000 messages and still have some issues after that. So I want to factory reset my phone. While I have not rooted my phone, I have performed significant customization, and have somewhere around 150 apps installed, including a few paid apps (UltimateJuice, ...). What things do I need to explicitly backup? What can I do to minimize the pain? I don't care about save points in games. Surprisingly, I cannot find any good documentation of this using any obvious Google search terms. (I am aware of How do I perform a full pre-rooting backup of an Android phone? , which doesn't really offer an answer to my question.) For Google cloud things such as contacts, do I need to backup the cloud version just in case, so the phone doesn't wipe them from the cloud? Fortunately, most of my personal notes are stored in cloud applications like Catch and Evernote. I presume these should be unaffected. As far as I can tell the BackupMySettings option is not available for my phone (Samsung Epic running 2.1). My paid apps come back from Market anyway, right? I guess I could pay $4 for MyBackupPro if it really made things simpler, but there would need to be some way to NOT backup the corrupted SMS database files. Also I am assuming carrier-bundled apps such as Swype will automatically work. P.S. I have Marigold Android Backup and backed up to the SD card (except SMS/MMS). I also have mIQ but I'm not sure I trust that to do a re

I have re-enabled and disabled iMessage. Unregistered the iPhone(s) from my Apple ID and it doesn't seem to work. AT&amp;T has tried to help but because they don't get this too often they couldn't help me. I have called Apple but they want me to pay $29 for any type of support. How can I receive group messages on my Galaxy S3? I'd hate to have to go back over this issue. 
1	Will I lose any apps / data if I upgrade my phone's OS?	updates samsung-galaxy-s-2	I'm planning to upgrade my Galaxy S2's OS from android 2.3 to 4.0. This is an official upgrade from Samsung. It sounds like it's an easy process. Just download the Kies program from Samsung and follow the instructions. But as I've never done it before on an android, would I still have all my apps and data?

1	Is it possible to pre-download a YouTube video to view it later offline?	youtube	I have the Galaxy S3, and I'd like to watch YouTube videos during my commutes. I like to watch long videos (around 1 hours), so I have no more than 1 video per commute. However, youtube video takes a lot of bandwidth and I have a cap on data usage. Besides, connection outside during peak hours tend to be slow, which makes the video pause to download a lot of times. Is it possible to pre-download a video at home (using my Wi-Fi, which is faster and has no data cap), and watch it on the way? I tried pausing it at home and let it download, but whenever the phone sleep (it sleeps often!), or the application switch from youtube to anything else, it seems all previous download will be lost.

1	How to restrict stranger messages in WhatsApp	whatsapp-messenger	How can I restrict other WhatsApp users from messaging me, who are not in my mobile contacts. Me and my friend have given a try by simply deleting my fiend contact number from my mobile, and he's still able to send me message in whatsapp-messenger. So, is it that, anybody can send messages to anyone in the world, provided if they know the mobile number? If so, where is the privacy? Is there a setting option? Do I have only one option to block them? I would like to see only people in my contacts list message me.

1	How to Disable Double Tapping?	samsung-galaxy-s-2 lock-screens	My Galaxy S2 asked me to double-tap and drag to unlock (instead of just dragging) and every time I try to tap anything, one tap only makes a yellow box appear around the app or file or whatever, which is really difficult to deal with and annoying. 
1	ADB can discover devices but not fastboot	adb boot fastboot bootloader	I've searched on the web about this problem and it's usually solved by installing the appropriate drivers. Problem is I'm on a Mac. When I plug in my device, it can be discovered when I run adb devices . I run adb reload bootloader and it goes into download mode (the mode you get when you hold Volume Down + Home button when powering up). Is this correct? I assume it is. Anyway, when it is in this stage, adb devices or fastboot devices yields nothing. I have tested this on i9100 and i9505.

1	How can I stream music/audio from Android and PC to Android device via WiFi?	wi-fi audio	I've searched for this for some time, and I've found several options that almost works. I have an Android device connected to my stereo and I want to be able to connect to it with either my PC or my Android phone and play whatever music I'm playing on the phone/PC on the device instead. I've tried SoundWire , which sort of works with PC->Android, though the sound is sometimes choppy, and I have to connect from the Android device instead of from the PC. I've tried Remote Droid Player and Twonky , that works with Music that's already on my device, and twonky beam seems to work if I find something on YouTube, but since most music I play is on Google Play Music, that doesn't do me much good either. So does anyone have a solution for this. What I basically need is to replace my long jack->rca cable with an Android device, if you can put it like that.

I have my Google account set up on my phone, which is useful, but if I can't specifically turn off Google notifications I'm going to have to unsync it, because as it stands I have to either silence all notifications and miss important text messages, or get woken up by G+ comments and NYT emails at 4 AM.

1	OTA Update on a rooted Nexus5 with Custom Recovery and Kernel	rom-flashing nexus-5 ota-update twrp 5.0-lollipop	A few months back, I rooted my Nexus 5 using Towelroot, installed TWRP and ElementX Kernel. Now as the Android Lollipop update is around the corner, I don't think I'll be able to install OTA update because of rooted phone and custom recovery. In some forums, I even read that it might mess up my phone. So now, I want to know what is the safest way to get the official Android Lollipop update, I don't mind losing root, custom kernel and all that, I even searched going all stock, but that seems like a cumbersome solution with many risks. One easy way I was thinking of is downloading the Android Lollipop System image (tgz file) when Google uploads it and flashing that into my phone using TWRP. However, I don't know how and can't find anything about how to flash a tgz file. Can I do it by placing it in the memory, booting into recovery/install/AndroildL.tgz. Will that do it? If yes, then what changes will it make> will my custom kernel and root be gone or not? Thank you 
1	my tablet is not using my external SD card for storage	4.2-jelly-bean internal-storage sd-card storage	I have an 8 gig SD card I plugged into my tablet. When I go to settings and look at storage I can see I have a 7.2 gigs free on my external SD card. I downloaded a 700 meg file to /mnt/sdcard/Download but after doing this and checking storage I see there is still 7.2 gigs free on my SD card. I also have torrent programs which point to this same location on my SD card to save files. but none of these programs can actually download any files because they are reporting this location as only having 100 megs free, so I have concluded that my tablet is lying to me. Mnt/sdcard isn't actually my sdcard! this is infuriating how do I fix this? This is an Azpen A727 . Android version: 4.2.2 I have rooted my tablet as well. Edit: okay so I read that the actual location of the SD card is a folder called mnt/extsd. I rooted my tablet but when I try to use the folder as the download location for my programs it says I don't have access how can I grant the programs access? I get error my app (a torrent) throws when trying to set the sdcard as the download location- the right location of the SD card. I can create folders extsd but can save any files there

1	Installing ROM from Fastboot -- Can someone help?	rom-flashing rom fastboot	I have a new HTC MyTouch (32A) that I tried to install a new ROM on using ROM Manager.

1	How can I fix this time-zone problem with calendar events that started after installing Android 2.3?	calendar time-zones	I'm using a Nexus One on T-Mobile in the US. A couple months ago my OS was updated to Android 2.3. Since then I've had a weird problem with my calendar events. I can view calendar events just fine, and the calendar syncs with my Google Account bi-directionally without issue. When I create a calendar event, the "time zone" option defaults to my current time zone, "GMT -4, Eastern Standard Time", just like it did on Android 2.2. However, when I touch the time zone option to select a time zone, there are two time zone entries that match mine. One is "GMT -4, Eastern Standard Time", the other is "GMT -4, Eastern Time". The problem happens when I edit an event. Frequently, when I edit a calendar entry, the event jumps 4 hours ahead unless I manually edit it back down. For example, if I create a calendar event and set the starting time to 1:00pm, when I edit the event I've created the edit screen will show a starting time of 5:00pm. It still shows the correct time zone, but it adds the 4 hour GMT difference into the event's starting time. If I save the event without adjusting it back down, the next time I edit it it will say 9:00pm. This happens regardless of whether the event was originally created on the phone, or if it was created on my desktop PC by visiting http://www.google.com/calendar . It doesn't seem to matter which of the two "US Eastern Time" options I select when creating an event on the phone. This problem did not exist before I installed Android 2.3. It doesn't happen with every single event, but I haven't been able to figure out what the common element is between the unaffected events. It does seem that events that are freshly-created are less prone to this problem (possibly the problem starts after the data's been synced a few times?) If I create a calendar event on my phone, and then edit it on my desktop PC using <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar" rel="nofollow"

1	How to find out if my Device's Kernel has Loop Device Support	kernel mount	I would assume most all of you know why I am asking this, but for those who don't, Loop Device Support of a Kernel on an Android device is utilized to mount a Linux Distro IMG file (Ubuntu or Debian, &amp; a couple others) to run the linux img in a Chrooted environment to run side by side next to your Android System. So there is tons of information on what Loop Device Support is (if you need a good explanation see Wikipedia's article.), and why you need it, but there is a great lack of explaination as to how you find out if your device supports it. The most information relating to it is that "most roms support it"... So down to the issue, how would one discover if my device currently supports it? Is there some script I can look at or something in the kernel I can view to find out if my device supports it? 
1	How do I recalibrate the battery of my phone?	battery-life clockworkmod-recovery calibration	After a year using my phone, I noticed the battery drains too fast, but after shutting down I manage to make it work again for a couple of minutes before it shuts down automatically. I read that to recalibrate the battery, you should fully charge it and by various means delete the batterystats.bin file. (examples with clockworkmod or using an app ) The thing is... "When you follow the steps to recalibrate your battery and delete the batterystats.bin file from your phone, you are getting rid of more than what you think Stored inside that batterystats.bin file, your phone keeps detailed logs of the capacity of your battery and uses it on how it can be utilized more efficiently." Read Full or oppositely, quoting Dianne Hackborn "It (refering batterystats.bin) has no impact on your battery life." I know it's not possible to make it as good as new, but at least reset it in a way it would read that last bit of energy accurately? 
1	How to restore files on SD Card that was protected by Vault app?	sd-card data-recovery	I changed my Android mobile phone from one carrier to another.

After installing the vault software in the new phone, I am unable to restore data (photos, videos) from old SD card. What might be the reason for this? Is there any way I can recover the files from my old SD card, which was protected by the Vault app. 
1	How can I enable/add USB OTG support to my rooted stock LG P500?	usb-on-the-go lg-optimus-one	I have a rooted LG P500 running stock 2.3.3 with kernel 2.6.35.10. I would like to use USB OTG features and connect a flash drive to my phone. I have a USB OTG cable that I use with my Nexus 7. The same cable and same flash drive doesn't work with my phone. I have tried to install StickMount , but unfortunately it is not compatible with my phone and so is the USB Host diagnostics - however, their database clearly says P500 does not support USB. Other than going the route of custom ROM, can some thing be done for enabling USB OTG like patching kernels etc? I am not sure even the previous statement is valid, but just thought of asking as in the database under "Rooted API Claims support" column, the value for LGP500 is said as Yes. And, I checked this XDA thread, which also says that the chipset MSM7227 which my phone uses has limited OTG capabilities. Also that thread's title says Update: Working now , but I couldn't find anything relevant within its posts. All these just gives me a faint hope. Update:My phone's has three files libra.ko, librasdioif.ko, wireless.ko in /system/lib/modules 
1	Is Android a 32-bit or 64-bit OS?	system tech-specs	The title is pretty much self-explanatory: is Android a 32- or 64- bit OS? I assume that it is one or another and not both, as that would force both 32- and 64-bit binaries to be hosted on Google Play. I know that this is a simple question, and that other people have been asking it, but for the life of me I have not been able to find an answer on the web, and there is certainly not one on this SE. 
1	Would Apple EarPods work on my Android phone?	headphones	Apple just launched the iPhone 5; together with that they landed new earphones they call 'EarPods'. I have an HTC Desire HD Android-based phone. It has a 3,5mm jack just as the iPhone. Would the earphones and microphone of the EarPods work on my phone as well? Having good quality earbuds that stick in my ear sounds attractive to me. I do not care about the controls per se, and I'm pretty sure the sound will also work, but I'm not sure about the microphone. Also, how much of the improved sound and noise reduction is implemented in the software?

I have tested this from my land line and sometimes the phone does everything it's supposed to and other times doesn't ring and doesn't log a missed call but records a voice mail. 
1	How can I determine the cause of random device reboots?	samsung-galaxy-s-2 4.0-ice-cream-sandwich reboot	After being annoyed with my previous ROM, I thought I'd install ICS on my SGS2 (until CM9 comes out). But, sadly, it now reboots several times a day without any real reason. The device is just lying there on the table doing nothing and every now and then the screen turns on and I can watch it reboot. So, how would I start to analyse this issue? Obviously I could try to flash different ROMs like a mad man until the issue resolves itself, but I would prefer a more sensible approach. 
1	Custom ringtone not working on Nexus 5 since OTA Lollipop	nexus-5 ringtone 5.0-lollipop	I've updated my non-rooted, vanilla Nexus 5 with an OTA update to Android 5.0 Lollipop and since then my custom mp3 ringtone stopped working. Here are the symptoms: When selecting it via the ringtone selector in the Sound &amp; notification settings panel, it plays properly. When someone else calls me, the default system notification sound is played repeatedly. Re-uploading the custom ringtone via AirDroid as an .mp3 file didn't work, nor did uploading an ffmpeg-encoded .ogg version of it. The same applies to my custom notification sound. I'm currently using one of the ringtones bundled with the system, and I'd love some help in solving this problem. Thanks!

1	How to prevent android from auto-sync'ing gmail contacts and photos etc	sync gmail samsung-galaxy-note-3 active-sync	I just got a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and when I go into my settings then add an account and add a gmail account, it gives me an option to choose what I want to sync. I unchecked 'photos' and 'contacts' and everything else except for 'gmail' but it still auto sync'ed my photos and contacts (and my apps and app data, even though I told it not to). I then deleted the account and tried again but this time, I didn't check anything at all (not even gmail) and it did not sync anything, which is good. But I want to sync only my mail, so then I went into the settings for my account and checked only the 'sync gmail' box and it synced Everything again (app, app data, contacts, photos).. how do I make it still syncing everything? I just want to sync my inbox.

There doesn't seem to be any mechanism for signing out of Skype once signed in. I can kill the task, but the next time anything triggers it it think it has the right to sign in and be online again, bar nothing. The task bar icon just takes you to the program, but the program doesn't seem to have any menus, doesn't respond the the back button etc. Ideas? 
1	Deleteing photos from device but still have them in the backup (default Google+)	backup nexus-5 google-plus google-backup google-plus-photos	I've been looking all over for a proper explanation of how to delete photos from the device (nexus 5) to reclaim some space, while being sure that the pictures are still in the Google+ backup.Unfortunatley i have not found one, other than "wild claims" it works somehow, while other say it does not.Plus deleting photos via the Pictures app actually warns you (now?) that it will delete the backed up copies too. Do i have to delete them in the Gallery app? I did delete some photos recently, and i was quite sure they ware still backed up (still showed up on the Google+ website) but looking now i see they are in the trash in the device. Is there really no way to be able to know for sure if the pictures are backed up savely while i can delete them from the device? Alternatively i'm also open for alternative solutions to this problem, or i just go back to the "good old copy and paste when plugging the phone". 
1	Is there a minimal installation of ADB?	adb installation	When it comes to troubleshooting , I often read recommendations like "Use adb logcat to find some more details". Looking for a good way to backup all my apps including their data, Full Backup of non-rooted devices refers to adb backup and adb restore . In several places one can find ways to remotely do on an Android device with the use of ADB , such as transferring files using adb push or adb pull , accessing the command-line via adb shell , and more. So ADB seems to be a good thing to have for an Android user. But how to get this "ADB thingy" on my computer? Not being a developer, installing the entire Android SDK seems a bit overkill. Is there a more minimalistic approach available?

1	Low space on HTC Desire with CyanoGenMod 7.1: how to solve it?	cyanogenmod htc-desire app2sd internal-storage	I have an HTC Desire GSM. This phone has the known problem of limited memory, so that it was impossible to install more than a couple of apps without running into the "Disk space low" problem. So I rooted it, installed CyanogenMod7 and App2SD. I moved to the SD card almost all of the application (except those that needs notifications: those won'd work if moved to the SD). Still, I periodically get the "Low space" message; it is as if the apps were storing their data on the phone memory. If I go to settings -> applications and clear some application's data, then clear the browser cache, I get rid of the message for a couple of days. How can I definitely get rid of the "Low space" notification, while keeping my applications installed? Please note: I've read that it could be possible to repartition the SD card and "mount" it so that it extends the phone own memory. I've seen several conflicting instructions about the procedure (and, e.g. the order of the partitions on the SD card) and, while I managed to partition the card, I never managed to have Android "mount" the extra partition. I've also read instructions saying that recent versions of Cyanogenmod don't support the sd partition anymore. The phone is already rooted, hence solutions requiring root are OK I installed Cyanogenmod 7.1.0, but I have not particular preference to that mod. If necessary, I am open to install any mod that works on the phone and is stable for everyday use. UPDATE: This wiki page is the reference that says that the sd partition is not supported anymore: Apps2ext (previously called apps2SD) moved all user installed apps to a secondary ext partition on your sdcard. This method had the advantage of being straight forward and simple, However, it had the drawback of being difficult to set up. This method is no longer officially supported by Cyano
1	How to unlock device when I forgot my password?	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich lock-screens security password locked-out	I've read Recovering from forgotten lock pattern which states that there is an option to disable the lock using my Google account information. However I did not noticed such an option when I entered my password five times wrong. (Although there was also a 20s or 30s delay to complicate brute force attacks.) I use Android 4.0.3 on a Asus Transformer Prime TF201. Would factory reset work? 
1	How to unlock Google Device Manager remote lock?	locked-out android-device-manager	I have a rooted Samsung S4 mini with the latest stable CyanogenMod installed (cm-10.2.1.3). I was playing with the Google Device Manager ( https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager ) and tried to lock the device. When I tried to unlock I found out, there is no keyboard or input box to enter the password into . The screen looks exactly the same as my lockscreen - I'm using the pattern lock which I remmember perfectly - besides there are just words: "locked" and the message I typed into the web remote lock. I can also see there is Android Device Manager running in background (icon in top left notification corner). Wherever I click or try to draw my pattern lock, the device does nothing (but it is not frozen as I can open the Power button menu). I also use a custom keyboard application and I removed the original CyanogenMod keyboard. Can this be a problem? Is there any option at the online Device Manager to remotely unlockthe device? The phone is rooted and I can connect via ADB in Recovery. Can I do something there - besides wipingthe device - to unlock the remote lock? 
1	Is it possible to record calls on Galaxy S3	samsung-galaxy-s-3 call-recording	I want to install a working call recording application on Galaxy S3, but I have found problems with a few apps. I have tried Auto Call Recorder but it doesn't allow me selecting more than Mic as audio source. Perhaps I can record only my own voice (I haven't tried further and I obviously haven't bought the full program) I have previously tried Call Recorder Pro but it only recorded my own voice and not the other party's. I have read here that most call recorder apps require root (OK for me) and Requires the kernel with 2-way call recording patch The question is, then How do I make a call recorder fully work on a Galaxy S3 (GT-I9300) with only root for now?Do I need to flash a custom firmware? Or won't it just work at all?

1	Can I have different volumes settings for notifications and ringtones with Nexus 4/Android 4.2?	4.2-jelly-bean volume-control nexus-4	My old Gingerbread phone would let me have a low volume for notifications while having a high volume for ringtones (very useful at night). My new Nexus 4 seems to have these volume settings tied together. Is there any way to separate them? I'm running Android 4.2.1 stock. Have looked at a Nexus 7 running 4.1.1 and it has separate volume streams so this looks like a phone specific bug/feature. Update Tried various apps but couldn't fine one which separated the Ring and notification audio streams. In the end I downloaded the Cyanogenmod notification sounds , selected the ones I liked and processed them to -10db and -15db versions. Then copied them to the 'Notifications' folder on the phone. (The phone looks at the title tag in the mp3 file rather than the file name so needed to change that as well.) I now have the ringtone as normal but a quieter version of the notification sound that doesn't wake me at night or sound ridiculously loud in meetings. 
1	How do I change the default SMS application on my HTC Hero?	sms htc-hero default-applications	I recently got completely fed up with the built in Messages (SMS) application and switched it out for Chomp (also looking at Handcent, haven't decided on one yet). I want to use the "Messages" icon though, as well as treat the new app as the default SMS program. I know about "Manage Applications" and clicking the "Clear Defaults" button for the app. But the "Clear Defaults" is disabled for the Messages app and it says that no defaults are set. I read on someone else's post that their AT&amp;T provider had somehow hardcoded this as the default app and they couldn't change it. So... Can they really do that? Is that why my HTC Hero doesn't let me clear the default? Is there a way around that?

1	Is there a way to record and playback a set of touches?	automation touchscreen	What I'm looking for is some sort of macro-recorder (though that term seems to be hijacked now my macro-photography apps). I'd like to record a set of presses (specifically, beating a level in a game), and then have those repeated for me so I can accumulate in-game currency without wasting my time or a ton of money. I imagine there would be other practical uses as well, but I'm not finding anything to do this in Google Play. MacroDroid and Tasker both looked promising, but you can only assign predefined actions to predefined events - not a set of touches.

After a long press on power button, I do have the "device options", however nothing happens when I press Airplane mode (airplane mode enable) . I am stuck in airplane mode. However this option is not disabled (greyed out) . Of course, I have a SIM , and it will be detected after a reboot. The other options from "device options" behave normally (I can turn of sound, turn off device or reboot). It just seems this part of the screen cannot be touched anymore. Have you experience this?

With the number of root certificates that have been compromised, and the number of fraudulent SSL certs created over the last couple of years, this is an issue for anyone relying on SSL for security, as otherwise you won't know if you want to remove any trusted CAs .

1	Insufficient storage available. Ok, but where?	updates internal-storage installation insufficient-memory	When I upgrade an Android application from Google Play, it gets downloaded, then the upgrade stops with the message Error: Insufficient storage available.

I today installed Android Device Manager and to test it's functionality I locked the phone with the password: "abcd" (4 letters were required). After entering the password and confirming with the "OK" button of my keyboard, the phone showed me that the password is wrong. "Senha incorreta". I reset the password after some tries to "123456" and the phone reloaded the lock screen. Again the password showed up to be wrong. I also tried the alphabetic password: "abcdefg" - same error. I changed the language of my Google account from German to Portuguese and reset the password to "123456" again and I tried to really reboot my phone and unlock the SIM card again. But anyways I can not get through my lock of the Android Device Manager. I tried to enter the password 35 times wrong with hope to get a chance to authenticate with my Google Account login. I also tried to connect the phone with adb but it does not show up in this state with: adb devices So what can I do to get access to my phone again? 
1	How can I recover a deleted file on Android?	data-recovery	I just deleted a file on my Nexus S that I really need back. (It was actually part of an app using a sqlite database that did a drop table when upgrading to a new version.) Presumably I need to root the phone first (which I hear is easy on Nexus phones) but am I in a catch-22 here? Namely, does rooting the phone mean wiping/overwriting the partition where the data lives? If not, what do you recommend for data recovery tools? Presumably the file was just unlinked and not actively overwritten (per usual when "deleting" a file) so technically the data must be there... 
1	How can I write in a PDF with a tablet and a pen (a.k.a Is there a Xournal alternative for Android)?	pdf	There is already a similar question , which is about the Xoom and note taking. But I'd like to ask this in a more general way: Given a tablet (and a pen), how can I write - not just adding notes and comments, more like one would write on paper - in a PDF? The additional writing should be saved within the same PDF file and readable/showable by the most common PDF readers. Essentially I am looking for an Xournal alternative for Android. 
1	Phone not appearing in Android Device Manager	android-device-manager	When I go to Android Device Manager , my tablet is listed, but not my phone. I had signed up just as soon as ADM was available, and at that time both devices were listed. Now, for the last several days, I can only see my tablet. (For what it's worth, both devices appear in the "My Devices" section of the Google Play Store.) I have done the following while troubleshooting: Ensured that the Android Device Manager settings in Google Settings are both on. I have even toggled them off and back on again Ensured that Location Services are on Ensured that all sync services for my account are toggled on and work Have connected to the Play Store several different times Ensured Google Play Services is at the latest version Made sure I'm using the right account. (In fact, I removed the other secondary accounts from the phone) Power-cycled the phone several different times I could understand if ADM couldn't find the phone due to it being off, out of range, poor signal, etc., but ADM would at least display the phone and tell me it couldn't find it. So, any suggestions to get my phone to show up on Android Device Manager? I would like this to be working before something happens to the phone. ( Murphy's Law and all that.) Although it shouldn't make any difference: Tablet: Nexus 7 (2012) with Android 4.3 Phone: Verizon Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.2.2 Addendum: There's apparently some (relatively new) advice on the Android Device Manager help page : Open <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_40A4F4BE88E2B8DD4784FA3CE03C065DD09B_3296

1	How to transfer huge files between Android phones only with ES File Explorer and Wi-Fi?	wi-fi file-transfer	I have few HD movies each occupying around 1Gb to be transferred from one Android phone to another. I've read the question How to transfer files over Wi-Fi without a hotspot and its answers. Even before reading the question, I explored transferring one of the above said movie file from my LGP500 to my Nexus 7 (2012) successfully using ES Explorer and Wi-Fi. Now at my work, I am trying to do the same to my friend's Micromax A110 and all my efforts goes vain. I tired to make Micromax A110 to host a random Wi-Fi network and I join my LGP500 to it before transfer. After selecting the file and choosing Send option, the upcoming UI just shows scanning... and a progress bar goes on and on. There are no visibility settings like Bluetooth in Wi-Fi transfer mode. I tried the reverse the connection and again it failed. I am bit puzzled and think I am missing something obvious. Can someone help by providing a step by step guide to transfer files between two Android devices with ES File explorer using Wi-Fi? I am sticking with Wi-Fi because the transfer rate was too good. I saw near to 10 MB/s. And I do not want to install other apps as I find ES File explorer available with many of my friends. Some trivia: My LG P500 is rooted and runs stock v2.3.3 My Nexus 7 is rooted and runs stock v4.3 My friend's A110 is not rooted and runs stock 4.0.1 Size of the file that I transferred successfully is 600Mb and facefailure on the same file.

What I have:Galaxy S4, 8GB internal, 64GB SD card, Omega ROM with Android 4.3 (TouchWiz); has Samsung camera AND Google camera (with Photosphere) which I prefer much more than the Samsung camera. Samsung camera makes it easy to store pix on ext. SD card. Cannot find any setting or way to do the same with Google camera. Even tried deleting DCIM on internal SD card, hoping I would be asked where I wanted to store pix. But DCIM and subfolders were just recreated on the internal SD card. With only 8GB internal, I need to clear more space out. That's why this is so important. Any help?

1	Why is my phone slow?	samsung-galaxy-nexus performance	My phone has lately been really slow. When I turn on the screen, particularly if it has been off for a while, the phone is really sluggish. For example, it might take 30 seconds to respond to my input. Or if someone calls, it might not respond to my answer gesture until after the caller has already given up and hung up. If I leave the screen on for several minutes (up to five), the phone will eventually start to respond more normally. The CPU information in the developer options shows that the processor is pegged during all this slowness, and the process system_server is consuming almost all of that CPU capacity with other processes fighting for a little CPU time. Also, this CPU activity is killing my battery. I'm only getting half the battery life I should be getting. I recently lost root in an OTA upgrade; in re-rooting I had to do a wipe of the phone. Once I restored everything, the problem came back. My phone is a Galaxy Nexus running Jelly Bean (4.1.2). I also experienced a similar issue with my previous phone, a Nexus One running MIUI and "ICS". I attributed that phone's slowness to its age, but now I think there must be something else going on. What could be wrong, or how could I go about tracking down the problem? Answers to questions posed My current phone is running 4.1.2. The problem became much worse after the update. My previous phone was the one I said was running "ICS". I put that in quotes because it was a custom ROM that claimed to be 4.0 but which I suspect was actually Gingerbread+. My RAM typically runs at about 85%. But, I doubt this is too useful since Android automatically kills apps when it needs more RAM and the Linux kernel is designed to keep RAM mostly full so as not to waste it. Currently, Google Maps is using the most battery, followed by Tasker. I'm quite sure that this isn't typical, however. I can't imagine why Google Maps would be so high, as I do

1	Unusual battery drain on note II	battery-life battery samsung-galaxy-note-2	My Note 2 battery is driving me insane. I have been using my Note 2 for like 2 months. And I had been following the recharging cycle where you only charge the battery when it reaches 5% or less and remove from socket when it reaches 100%. This method has been working real well for me. I used to get really good battery life. I would recharge it to 100 and remove from socket and keep it there. I might only start working with it after 2 hrs of idle time a nd the battery percentage would be like 98 which is pretty normal. But two days back when I had to go out I found my battery level at 24 % and since I had no other choice I had to recharge it for 10 mins. That's when the problem started. After coming back home the battery had pretty decent juice left in it and I left it idle. After an hour or two when I checked the phone it had already switched off. I was in shock and tried to switch it on but it didn't work. So I thought of charging it to 100. After almost 3 hrs it was fully charged but since I don't work on my phone so late in the night, I removed it from socket, switched it on and left it there idle. And when I woke up after 5 hrs it had only 69% juice left in my battery. I checked my running apps and there were none. I had my data connection stopped. And still only 69? Thats kinda weird right? Is it because I recharged it before getting to 5 %. Is there a way I can remove the battery cycle cache or something?

1	How to transfer text messages from iPhone to Android with iOS 5?	sms samsung-galaxy-s-2 ios data-migration	I'm trying to switch from an iPhone 3GS to a Galaxy SII and got multiple questions. This one concerns migrating the text messages (SMS).I've found quite some articles, basically they fall into two categories: Getting the text message SQLite database from the Itunes backup and exporting stuff manually to CSV files. Importing the SQLite database directly with tools. Most pages link to this article Problem:Apparently, this only works in IOS &lt; 5.0 or Itunes &lt; 10, don't know. With newer backups, the SQLite database can not be opened anymore, the Android tools mentioned do not work anymore. So I'm looking for any other suggestions on how to correctly migrate the text messages to Android. Note: I'm aware that maybe this is more a iPhone question than Android. Nevertheless, I hope to find someone here who faced the same problems. This is exactly the reason why I'm migrating in the first place.

I have an international android smartphone which doesn't have anything related to Google Play Store installed.

1	How can I physically remove the internal memory device from my Samsung Galaxy S2?	samsung-galaxy-s-2 hardware unbricking	My Galaxy S2 has recently died completely over night. It does not turn on regardless of which combination of buttons I try and how long I press them. I've tried with two different batteries, without a battery, SIM, no SIM and so on. It still seems to recharge the battery as it builds up heat when connected to a charger in the top left corner below the display side camera. Since I'm certain it is beyond repair I've ordered a new phone and am now thinking about how to get to the stuff that was not on the SD card of the broken one, which I neglected to backup for a few month. I've been thinking about removing the memory device physically. No harm done if I break anything else as I consider it broken already anyway. Unfortunately, there are hardly any resources on the internet that I was able to find in that regard. So my question is simple: where is the internal memory in the S2 and how can I rip it out? I don't care if I break any other components as long as I get to that memory device.

1	Is it possible to stream a tablet screen to desktop via bluetooth to a PC?	bluetooth screen-sharing	This way you could give a presentation (and make annotations), show movies on your tablet and stream it to your PC/laptop which is connected with bluetooth (in e.g. a classroom) with no need to go to the PC. Has anybody used this setup? As a teacher it would make a smartboard out of my tablet (which i would buy for this purpose, amongst few others) and a simple bluetooth dongle which I could plug in the school PC. Looks simple to me, but probably isn't as simple as I imagine? I'm even prepared to pay a fee for an app if this is available. 
1	Regarding the "Error Downloading: insufficient space" error in the Google Play store	google-play-store 4.4-kitkat insufficient-memory google-play-services	I've spent a long, long time searching for a viable, long-term fix for this problem; though I'm beginning to believe that Google Play (or Google Play Services) is to blame. I recently factory reset my phone running KitKat 4.4.2, which has both 16GB of Internal Storage (not an internal SD Card) and a 16GB external microSD card. Even with over 12GB of space remaining (after the factory reset, I was free to download apps from the store with no errors for a while, though it was visibly running a different version), it gives me this error. This is 12GB of Internal Storage, I have over 7GB more on the SD card. I'm currently at a loss about this. I've attempted to rollback both the Store and the Services apps, and it only clears me to download apps for 5-10 minutes (if that) before giving me the same old error. Error while downloading There is insufficient space on the device. Update: While writing this question up, yet again I attempted to download three apps. The first proceeded through the process without any issue (keep in mind that I had not changed anything since the last time an error was encountered - I simply unlocked the phone and clicked install on the already-open Play Store page for Facebook Messenger), while the second and third spat out the same old error. I have attempted to clear my cache/move it to another partition, clear the data on both the Store and Services apps as well as the caches, and several other things. APK files never fail to install when attempting to install from an external source. This issue is also not local to this phone alone, my previous model did the exact same thing without the allowance for one download that I just experienced. Edit regarding "duplicate question": Whether this is a duplicate question or not, I have found no valid solution for this, regardless of how many threads I have looked at and how many different methods I have tried. I've purchased a new cellphone to try an

1	Problem with Android Emulator on Android Studio. HAXM Kernel Module not Installed	windows android-emulator android-sdk development intel-haxm	I recently switched over from Eclipse ADT to Android Studio and as soon as I tried to fire up the emulator, I saw the following message: emulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration! Please ensure Intel HAXM is properly installed and usable. CPU acceleration status: HAX kernel module is not installed! On Googling around, I found that disabling Hyper-V would solve this problem. It did. And the emulator worked like a charm. But then, my internet stopped working. In any form. WiFi, Ethernet, every kind of service went bust. Re enabling Hyper-V restored my internet connection, but the error came back. So, I can either use the internet or my emulator. I really can't keep doing that. Is there an alternate to this?

I am interested because I wanted to do some themeing and so far I had edited SystemUI.apk, but if I ever ran into any problems (and being a beginner that was bound to happen) nothing seemed to happen other than the fact that I lost my notification bar. Problem is, I have heard of some people who touched framework-res.apk and they wound up not being able to even boot their phone. I decided before carelessly poking around with something that could potentially soft brick my phone, I would like to learn a bit more about it. So what exactly is framework-res.apk? What is it used for? What does it control? Where do we visually see its use? What could potentially happen to my phone should something go amiss with framework-res? Anything else I should know before poking my nose where it shouldn't be? 
1	Why does my Android device slow down after successive ROM updates without wiping?	cyanogenmod rom-flashing performance	I have a 32 GB Verizon Galaxy Nexus (toro). I am running Cyanogenmod 10.1 ROM nightlies and I use CyanDelta Updater to stay up to date. For a period of about 3 weeks, I updated to the latest nightly nearly every day using CyanDelta. Sometimes I'd download the full ROM instead of using CyanDelta. During this time, I never wiped the device (aka factory reset). I just applied the new release on top of the old. Recently, my phone's performance degraded significantly. There were long delays unlocking, long delays switching apps, long delays doing just about everything. The phone would freeze up, and the OS would ask if I wanted to end a process because it wasn't responding. My podcatcher would stutter while playing. Instead of switching to another ROM, I decided to first do a full wipe (factory reset). I used Titanium Backup to back up my user apps and data. In TeamWin Recovery, I did a factory reset, flashed the same CM 10.1 nightly I was running previously, restored my apps using Titanium, signed into accounts, etc. My phone's performance has been completely restored. It's like night and day. My question is: Why did that work? What is it about applying successive ROM versions that could cause a slowdown that a wipe would fix? I love my new level of performance, but I also enjoy keeping up with the latest releases. It would seem I can't have my jelly beans and eat them too. Now I'm reluctant to flash any updates without doing a full wipe.

I can't get rid of it; the clear button doesn't clear it, and neither does tapping it. It's just taking up space. How can I get rid of it? I've got 20 MB of free space on my phone, which isn't a lot, but it's sufficient. I already know how much space is available, so a constant reminder serves no purpose, as there's nothing I'm willing to delete to free up space. This is a Google/HTC Nexus One running Android 4.0. (Quite an old phone to be running ICS, but it was like that when I aquired it secondhand.) Edits in response to the comments and answers: I've already moved all possible apps to the SD card, and even a few that weren't supposed to be moved there. Unfortunately, Android insists on keeping some stuff on the phone, even when the apps are moved off. As a Linux user, I can't understand this. By a combination of choosing the $PATH well and manipulating mount points and symlinks appropriately, I can't see why it should make any difference to the system where the app is installed. I've already cleared the cache. There's not much there, since I've been aggressive in my cache management. I've even cleared out several apps' data. I haven't yet gotten around to moving my data to the SD card, as I asked about here . I think it'll only amount to a few MB of savings, though.

1	How do I invoke "su" from a terminal prompt?	command-line root-access	I can get a root prompt in the terminal by running one exploits documented elsewhere. (e.g. here: http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Motorola_Droid_2_Global:_Full_Update_Guide ) At this point, I can install the "su" binary and give it permissions 4755. This should allow anyone to execute it, and since the owner of the binary is "root" and the sticky bit is set, I should become root. But I apparently have no way of un-become root from the terminal short of rebooting. But, after I reboot, then I can't seem to become root using 'su'. $ ls -l /system/bin/su-rwsr-xr-x root app_101 26234 2012-07-09 15:00 su Ok, the permissions look fine, should I should be able to run it to become root, but only in this particular invocation of the terminal. $ /system/bin/suPermission denied It also fails if i specify the command to run as root, or with any other arguments: $ /system/bin/su /system/bin/shPermission denied Why? Is there some other mechanism at work? I don't want to install Superuser.apk, because I just want a way that I can temporarily get a root shell if needed, for instance to delete unwanted files manually. Besides, Superuser.apk relies on the su binary anyway, so it must have some way of calling it, so why can't I replicate that in the terminal? Edit:I had another thought, so I tried copying /bin/sh to another locattion and made it suid root. But while I can execute the new binary, it doesn't give me root. Is Android doing something tricky/different with suid that regular Linux does not do?

However, they leave voice mails which creates this notification on my phone: Click the image for larger variance But I cannot swipe away this notification. It is a constant and persistent notification. Is there a way I can either: Never show voicemail notifications (without having to call T-Mobile and disable my voicemail box) Swipe to remove the notification or hide the notification (via an app or similar?) I am rooted on a stock Nexus 5. I would have just used Google Voice as my voice mail box but apparently T-Mobile prepaid lines cannot have call forwarding so I can not use that option.

1	Is there a way to permanently turn off Google Maps until needed?	2.2-froyo google-maps intents disable-app auto-start	Google maps seems to have an insane amount of Intents registered for it, as well as other ways of being started. Since this is a pretty resource hungry app (especially memory wise), I would very much want it permanently not running unless/until I actually need it. However, Android keeps starting it all the time - for example, when the connectivity status changes (which for me happens pretty frequently indoors), or GPS/network location changes. Is there some way of ensuring that Google Maps doesn't start ANY processes, guaranteed, until I click on an icon to deliberately launch it? Environment : Droid X, running rooted stock Froyo 2.2; I have Autostarts . and Advanced Task Killer, as well as Pro version of Titanium Backup installed. I'm fairly open to almost any method as long as It's reliable. It lets me use Google Maps with 100% intended functionality once I DO need it, without requiring 5 minutes of work to re-configure. Ideally, doesn't require me to reboot to use it, but this one is not a deal killer. I would STRONGLY prefer a generic method which would be applicable to other applications, NOT just Google Maps. I'm a software developer with a hefty dose of Unix/Linux system administration experience. In other words, solutions which require shell prompt or writing/running shell scripts (or Perl in Android Scripting Environment) are extremely welcome. Solutions involving writing my own Java Android app are acceptable as long as they are detailed enough than a total Android development newbie can get at least some work done without being 100% lost. Things I tried: Killing the processes via Task Killer is NOT working - they come back up, either immediately or in a litt

I have the "Developer options" enabled, and "USB debugging" is checked When going through the list on the page I did not install Samsung drivers first, as it is out of order on the page, so I went back into Device Manager and removed the drivers that installed from first plug in of the phone thinking this was the problem I then followed the steps again, installing Samsung driver first then plugging in my phone. After all drivers installed I rebooted (as computer told me reboot required), plugged my phone in again, and USB debugging is still not an option. Computer OS: Windows 7 (64 bit)Phone: SCH-1605 (Samsung Galaxy Note II - Verizon)Phone OS: Android 4.4.2 resolution using this howtogeek link provided in the accepted answer I was able to install the Java JDK and Android SDK, which apparently is necessary to get it to work as expected and put my phone in debugging mode when plugged in 
1	How to remove unused folders created by apps?	automation maintenance file-management	When I started with a fresh SD card, there were only very few folders in it. As time passed by when I tried many apps, I could see the folder list in my SD card seems to grow. It is understandable that while an app is being uninstalled, it leaves behind its folder where it would have kept few files, which may be the settings file or game scores etc. Is there any way I can remove all those orphaned folders in a batch or short operations? I have seen the question " How do one know which folder is created by which android apps " and can manually do it, but I am interested in kind of automatic solution. My phone info: LG Optimus One (P500) running stock 2.3.3 V20D (rooted). 
1	How to upgrade android market to Google play	google-play-store 2.1-eclair	I am using Micromax Android A60( version android 2.1 ) phone since two years ago.Now the Market app is not working. When I download any other app it gives error download unsuccessful. Even the Facebook app which is already downloaded to the phone is also not working. Is this problem because of Market is not upgraded to Google Play? Why is my mobile is not upgrading Market to Google play? How can I upgrade it? On Google I got following steps to upgrade Market App but not able to do 3rd step. Follow these steps to upgrade it manually on your Android device: Go in to Settings in your Android device and then Apps. Look for Market under the "All" tab and then press clear data. Now open the newly updated Play Music app (Google Music). (This step not found) Hit that little Market icon in the bottom tray. Confirm Google Play upgrade. 
1	Google Play Services taking more and more storage	2.2-froyo htc-desire internal-storage google-play-services	I'm using HTC Desire A8181 with Android version 2.2.2. I'm currently running out of free internal space. Besides of some applications growing bigger from release to release, the greatest space consumer is Google Play Services . It is currently using 13,55MB and is automatically upgraded, taking more and more space. Soon I'll be forced to deinstall some of the apps because of that :( Is there anything I can do with that Google Play Services? For example, can I safely uninstall it, install older version or tell it to move to external storage? My phone has barely 2 years and it's in danger of running unusable, while normally I'm using electronic devices 5 to 10 years... 
1	HTC Desire crashed, deleted all SMS/MMS. Can I recover?	sms htc-desire mms data-recovery	Been a reader of SO/SE for a while as am getting into Android development. Just wanted to ask a quick question. Hope someone can help. :) I have a HTC desire (2.2 with HTC sense, as per stock), never rooted and little used (basic apps installed, not used for any dev) I use as just a phone really. Hence I was very surprised when it crashed the other day and all my SMS/MMS were deleted (the stock HTC Messages app was empty)! I know I should not have rebooted the device (as file recovery may be easier as it reduces chances of file space being overwritten), but was told to do so by T-Mobile advisor. Upon reboot, found the stock HTC Messages app used for SMS/MMS was was now populated by SMS that was saved on the SIM. Hence I think, the Desire recreated the SMS/MMS content using the saved SIM messages as a start. What I would like to know is can the older SMS/MMS be recovered? I assume they are stored in.../data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/smsmms.db...and that this file (originally with 500+ messages) has been overwritten by a new smsmms.db (now containing ~5 messages), but as I am new to Android/Linux am not sure if this assumption is right e.g. the new smsmms.db file could be written to a different disk location (as is common on FAT32/NTFS file systems in Windows) and hence with the right know-how the original file can be recovered (I've recvered many files like this in Windows without issue). Does anyone know how to recover SMS/MMS messages like that, or how to recover/undelete files from these devices in general (I don't mind if it is only a partial file and I have to rebuild/extract messages). 
1	What are the differences between a system app and user app?	applications rom system titanium-backup	As I've played around with different ROMs and used Titanium Backup, I see that apps are categorized into system and user apps. Several ROM developers state that Titanium Backup should only be used for user apps and not for system apps, and when I proceed to uninstall system apps, TiBu warns me that the ROM may not work correctly. Other than the fact that user apps are downloadable via the Market or some other means, what are the key differences between the two? What is it about the system apps that make them more integral to the OS itself?

1	How to use an USB-attached wired Ethernet adapter through USB-OtG on an Android smartphone?	networking usb-host-mode usb-peripherals	Due to my profession I use to have to connect to wired-only LAN-attached devices (like managed switches, routers, set-top-boxes etc) frequently to access their configuration interfaces via Telnet/SSH/HTTP. And I am totally tired of carrying a bag with a laptop with me wherever I go. I have just bought a Samsung Galaxy Ch@t B-5330 (Android 4.1.2) smartphone (almost the only modern model with a physical QWERTY on the market today, certainly the only QWERTY by Samsung) and an USB-OtG ("USB host") cable for it. It would simplify my life significantly if I could connect it to wired Ethernet networks. Is this possible? Where do I even start? It seems to be no custom firmwares like Cyanogen Mod available for my particular model but I am most probably going to root it. I've got a USB NIC based on ASIX AX88772 chip (which is detected by Ubuntu out of the box and is said to be compatible with XBox, PS3 and Apple Macs so it seems to be a very standard kind). Also, I have not even found a single USB device (I have tried an USB flash drive, a keyboard and a mouse) which would work with the Android phone. It seems that they don't even receive power from it. Perhaps it (USB host mode) should be switched on somewhere in settings? I couldn't find where. 
1	Can I use my phone as a bluetooth game controller for my computer?	bluetooth games	I've seen BT Controller but I think it only allows users to use their android as remote for other androids. I just want to use my phone as a bluetooth controller with up , down , left , right , L , R , start , select , A , B buttons for my computer. Is there an app that makes this a possibility? Basically, there are generic bluetooth game controllers that can be bought on stores. I was wondering if I can make my Android phone act like such and be used on computers. 
1	Samsung Soft Keyboard Keeps Popping Up when Bluetooth Keyboard in Use on Galaxy Note 10.1 with Android 4.1.2	keyboard samsung-galaxy-note external-keyboard	Models: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, GT-N8013 (WiFi) and SCH-I925 (4G LTE)Android version 4.1.2 I've been experiencing problems with the overly aggressive Samsung soft keyboard popping up whenever I touch the screen to select an input field, even though I am using a Bluetooth keyboard, and only intend to use a Bluetooth keyboard with this device. Constantly having to dismiss the soft keyboard is a major hindrance to filling out complex forms.In an attempt to work around the problem, I tried installing the Null Keyboard app from Google Play. This works for a while, however whenever the Bluetooth connection is lost and reestablished, the Samsung soft keyboard, even though not selected as the default, pops up the following message: Change input Method. To use Bluetooth keyboard, change input method to Samsung QWERTY The Samsung soft keyboard then resets itself as default input method. I have tried other workarounds, such as using the Perfect Keyboard app and decreasing its size to the bare minimum, but unfortunately the Samsung keyboard still watches like a hawk and pops up its insipid dialog and resets itself as the default every time a Bluetooth keyboard connection is established...and then proceeds to pop itself up at the first opportunity. This is irresponsible behavior. The Samsung soft keyboard knows the Bluetooth keyboard is there, yet not only can't it just go away when the Bluetooth keyboard is active, it insists on resetting itself as the default input method regardless of which alternative keyboard you may have selected. Yes, I know I could root it and disable the otherwise undisableable Samsung keyboard, but unfortunately I need to be able to deal with this solution on about two dozen units in field deployment, so I pretty much need to keep things safe and simple. I'm not trying to do anything crazy - just use a Bluetooth keyboard for one of the primary reasons

1	Are there any risks to rooting a device?	rooting	I see lots of tutorials telling me how to root my phone (Motorola Droid), but none of them mention any potential "side effects." Aside from a few relatively minor issues that seem to require rooting to fix, I'm basically happy with the phone and therefore a little leery of messing with a device that cost me a lot of money and is only a few months old. Assuming that I'm just talking about rooting, and none of the typical post-root actions (like installing a custom ROM), am I taking any risks by choosing to root? Does it have the potential to brick the device? Will it void my warranty? Will I stop getting updates? Will the cops show up at my front door the next day? (Yes, I'm being facetious.) Anything else I should be aware of? (See also: Are there any risks to flashing a ROM? )

1	Text multiple people on Nexus 5 - KitKat / Hangouts 2.3	sms 4.4-kitkat nexus-5 google-plus-hangouts	I have been unable to figure this out. I have seen multiple instructions online but none of them describe what I see on my phone. I am running the latest KitKat and Hangouts and I want to create a new SMS and add multiple recipients from my address book. I start by typing a name, for example "Bob", and then choose Bobs number from the list that pops up as I'm typing. It then jumps to the current SMS conversation I am having with Bob. There is literally no where for me add another person to send the text to. I don't seem to be able to start a fresh SMS conversation with multiple people. So basically how can I send a text message to several people? EDITED: Added some screen grabs below to show y'all what I'm seeing. Yellow marks are me tapping that area and the next image is what happens after the tap.

1	How to access phone internal storage during flashing?	cyanogenmod rom-flashing htc-one-x	I am flashing CM10 to my HTC One X. I downloaded all necessary files and unlocked my boot loader. I followed all steps on how to install this ROM, but I did one stupid thing. I forgot to copy the CM10 zip file to my phone internal storage. Below are the steps I followed, then I missed step 1. How do I access my phone internal storage so that I can save the zip file, and continue flashing my phone? Copy the CM10 ZIP file to your phones internal SD card. On the PC, extract the Fasboot.zip. You will get a folder named Fastboot. Extract the boot.img file from the cm10_endeavoru-ota-eng.noeri-028.zip file and place it into the Fastboot folder. Turn your phone off. Boot to Fastboot Mode. Hold down the Volume Down and the Power buttons until the screen turns on to enter Bootloader Mode. In Bootloader Mode, highlight Fastboot Mode using the Volume keys and select it by using the Power button. Connect your phone to your PC via USB cable. Open a command prompt on your PC and navigate it to the Fastboot folder. In the command prompt, type fastboot devices to check if your device has successfully connected to your PC. Your phones serial number should appear on the screen. Flash the boot.img by typing the following in the command prompt: fastboot flash boot boot.img Go back to your phone and select Bootloader to go back to the main Bootloader menu. In Bootloader Mode, highlight Recovery using the Volume keys and select it by using the Power button to boot into ClockworkMod Recovery. Select Wipe data/factory reset > Yes. Select Install ZIP from SD card > Choose ZIP from SD card > select the cm10_endeavoru-ota-eng.noeri-028.zip file > Yes. Select Go back > Reboot system now.

My phone worked fine again, except that my camera doesn't show me any image while running. I can take pictures and videos, but I'm blind while filming.I'm presuming this is because I still have the custom kernel installed. I would like to get back to an official Samsung kernel compatible with my old stock rom. Where can I find such a kernel? How can I be sure that it is the right one for my ROM? What steps must I take to ensure that I can at least get back to the current state if something goes wrong in the process?

1	Resize photo before sending it by email?	email photos gallery	On iOS, when I select one or more photos from the camera storage and choose to send them by email, the OS will ask me whether to send the images in full size or make them smaller so that the email won't be so large. On Android (stock 4.2.2 on Nexus 4) I haven't found a comparable function. When I send an email of my baby to my mom, she receives a full 8-megapixel image that's too large to view on her monitor... How can I have Android reduce the chosen photos before emailing them? I don't want to have to launch an editor app and scale each image individually. I only found one 2-year-old post about this that doesn't mention any solution. Surely, there's a way to do this on Android, similar to how it's done on iOS?

1	Mediaserver using excessive CPU time and battery	battery battery-life 4.2-jelly-bean	I've got a Nexus 4 on OS version 4.2.1 that suddenly started to drain it's battery very quickly. When looking in the battery usage I see "Mediaserver"eating 60% of the battery over time, with several minutes of CPU time logged and several hours of Keep Awake time. Typically the screen, phone idle or other services eat up the majority of battery life. I tried closing all apps and charging it up, and sure enough overnight it still drained significant battery, again Mediaserver was the culprit as reported in the Battery usage chart; it had kept the device awake all night and drained 10% of my battery despite zero use. I haven't added a large number of files and I'm not playing music/etc so Mediaserver shouldn't be doing very much on the drive. How can I stop Mediaserver from eating my battery life like this?

Essentially I'm looking for something that works the same was as WiFi direct (allows two phones to transfer files over WiFi) but that would be compatible with any computer with WiFi. So far I have tried creating an ad-hoc connection from the phone (as I can't take the computer being ad-hoc-creating-able for granted) using Android WiFi Tether and connecting the computer to the device, testing the different modes it offers (WEXT, Netd &amp; Softap). I have tried to connect to and from the computer over LAN, FTP and SMB without any success. I feel like I'm missing some small step over here. I've looked through multiple other posts, but I couldn't find any that would show a way to do this without actually connecting to an already available wifi network.

After updating to KitKat 4.4.2 (using the official Motorola process), I can't hear the caller's voice. But when activating the speakers or using a headphone I can hear the other side.

1	How can I fix the slow freezing text messaging app on my MyTouch 3G Slide?	sms htc-mytouch-3g-slide	I have a MyTouch 3G Slide w/ Android 2.2 and am having issues with the text messaging freezing up all the time and running incredibly slow. If I try to delete all the texts, the messaging application will continue to show the circular thinking pattern for over an hour and never delete all the texts. I ended up having to delete 3 texts at a time and waiting 5 minutes each time.... It's really frustrating... I have tried handcent sms and have the same issues with it 1) Is there a fix for slow/freezing text messaging other than factory reset? 2) Is there an app that deletes text messages over 2 weeks old? 3) Is there a better text messaging app than the onboard android messaging application for android 2.1 with better reliability, ease of use, and speed?

1	How to use an Android phone or tablet to make a projector presentation?	video-out	I have planned for some time to use a smartphone or tablet to give scientific presentations via projector, instead of using a laptop. I'm now thinking about buying a new Android smartphone, if I can be sure that in the end I'll be able to realize this goal with it. So my main question is: What do I have to look out for in order to get a device with which I can give projector presentations? I apologize that this question is not exactly about a concrete problem I'm faced with right now I just don't want to purchase a costly device only to find out later that I can't do with it what I want. I therefore did some thinking and research about the possible problems, and ask you for advice on how to avoid a concrete problem to occur in the first place. Here are some issues that occurred to me: In my experience most projector installations in lecture halls still only provide access to a VGA connector. I know that VGA as an analog signal requires D-A conversion from a digital signal, but I'm confused about how much effort this takes: Some converters have the shape of a box which needs an extra power supply, others are very small and don't need extra power. What is the difference between these different types of devices, and which kind do I need? Please note that the links are only meant as examples, I'm not asking specifically about these products. Again in my experience, most installed projectors do not yet support Full HD, but still need signals at resolutions like 800x600 or 1024x768. At least <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0085B5KPQ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;ps

And how do you disable something like that when the option is not there? Can this be done from HBoot menu?...

1	Is there a way to force an app to remain running in the background no matter what?	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich ram samsung-galaxy-s-3	On Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) the OS categorizes your app and each category has its own threshold in which the OS uses for determining which app to close first when it runs out of memory. Has anyone of you been annoyed by, say you opened a timer to run in the background to measure the time elapsed of something, then you opened few more apps and got back to your timer just to see it was reset or closed? I mean, seriously, it is really excruciatingly annoying. Is there a way to force an app to remain running in the background no matter what even when the OS runs out of memory?

1	Galaxy Gio doesn't find GPS satellites after minutes of searching	gps samsung-galaxy-gio	I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Gio (GT-S5660). When I try to connect to the GPS satellites, 75% of the time the built-in GPS is unable to locate me within a few minutes. I keep seeing the blinking GPS icon. The other 25% of the time I get a GPS signal within 15 seconds. Is this unusual behavior? If yes, what can I do to find the cause of the problem? Are there any known "death grip" issues related to GPS chips? I should note that I don't have a data subscription for my phone and I've disabled mobile internet on my device, but I have offline maps (certain areas in Google Maps and my entire country in MapDroid) so the GPS chip should be able to operate without data or WiFi.

I would have thought that if this was a global bug issue, that it would have been fixed by now, so I am guessing that there is something I need to set/reset. What do I do to fix this?

1	Contact search in Xperia Z doesn't show all contacts	contacts sony-xperia-z	The contacts system on my Xperia Z doesn't search through all my contacts, for some reason. All of the contacts were imported from my Google account, which has no groups or anything special. As an example, I have the following contacts: Antti H*****Antti J*****Antti K*****Antti S***** Now, if I search for antti , I only get the last two contacts. The same applies for sending SMS messages. If i compose a new SMS and tap the recipients field and write Antti , it only shows details for the same two contacts as the contact search. For the other two, I have to go to Contacts, scroll to the contact, tap it and then tap the SMS button. The type of the phone number (home, mobile, work...) doesn't affect this. The contacts work fine otherwise (show up on incoming calls, SMS threads etc.). It seems that the contacts that do show up are the ones I have on Facebook. However, I can't find any settings that specify which accounts to search. Is there some setting that I've failed to find? Oh yeah, everything is stock, but not vanilla. Edit: Tried searching with Google Now, but that won't find the contacts either. 
1	Haptic feedback settings in Android 4.1.1?	settings 4.1-jelly-bean haptic-feedback samsung-galaxy-s-3-mini	Just got a Samsung Galaxy S3 mini with Android 4.1.1 factory installed. The phone is not locked to any carrier. My problem is that I can not for the life of me find the setting to turn on the haptic feedback, neither for the keyboard nor other touch events (such as the menu button, etc.). I've looked through the settings menus several times without finding anything. The actual vibration hardware is working, because if I go to Settings -> Sound -> Device Vibration it vibrates. The only other mention of this issue I've found was one unanswered thread on the Samsung Galaxy Forums. This is the kind of thing that makes me wonder if Google (and others) are actually trying to make things worse with every update. My HTC Nexus One running Android 2.3.6 never had any oddities like this. Only problem with that old phone is it's limited internal memory.

1	Samsung S3 Cannot Enter Recovery Mode, and Can't Boot Up Either	samsung-galaxy-s-3 recovery-mode boot hard-reset	I'm trying to fix a Samsung S3 which has been stuck on the boot logo continously, and cannot boot up. The phone keeps displaying the logo (which says "Samsung" and the phone model) when the power button is pressed, and it will not shut off unless I remove the battery. My first attempt at fixing this was to enter recovery mode (holding the power button, volume up, and home button at startup), but the diagonistic menu didn't show up. Repeated attempts of removing the SIM and SD cards first also resulted in failure... nothing happened when I held those keys down. Strangely, download mode (holding the power button, volume down, and home button) worked. The screen lit up with a prompt to enable the mode. However, the phone isn't mine (I'm just helping someone fix it) and they don't want to reflash their firmware if possible. I have done rooting before and understand the process, but since it's not mine the risk is too great. Will reflashing the firmware fix the problem? Is this a hardware or a software issue? What does it mean if I can't enter recovery mode? 
1	WhatsApp contact's icon not showing	contacts instant-messaging whatsapp-messenger	I have WhatsApp installed on my HTC Sensation running Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread).

When I view the contact in my address book, they have an icon (headshot) either from Google contacts, Facebook, or some other social service. Why do only some of my WhatsApp contacts have icons showing? The other WhatsApp contacts default to an Android avatar. I've refreshed the WhatsApp contacts list and the problem still persists.

1	Android: huge thumbdata4 file in DCIM folder	thumbnails	I have recently noticed a huge (>3.5GB) file in the DCIM/.thumbnails folder. I have tried deleting it, but the next time I open the Camera app it rebuilds the file (and locks up the phone, sometimes displaying a "media scanning in progress" message, in the process.) The total file size of all the (approximately 2,000) photos displayed in the Gallery is around 500MB. There are in addition around 35,000 images in folders which contain .nomedia files to instruct Android to ignore the media therein. The total file size of these is around 1.5GB. The Gallery app is correctly ignoring these images, but I wonder whether the Camera app is misbehaving and actually processing them. I think this problem has emerged since the ICS upgrade ... either when the phone (Samsung Galaxy Note) was first updated from Gingerbread or at some later date. Any ideas, please?

Now I have a new LG phone with Android 2.3.6.I want to have on the new phone all the contacts I had on the old one. I mean the contacts that you see when you tap on the Contacts icon. It should be a complete no-brainer, but apparently it isn't. Note: I don't use the GMail application neither on the old phone nor the new one, and I don't want to. I do have my @gmail.com account set as the main account for both phones. On both the old and new phone, under Settings -> Accounts and Sync, the "Auto-sync" option is enabled.Also, under the ...@gmail.com account listed below "manage accounts", I have enabled both "Sync people details" and "Sync contacts", both on the new and old phone. However, my contacts don't get synced. I have a lot of contacts in the old phone that I can't find in the new one.The new phone apparently has imported all the mess of useless contacts from gmail (i.e. email addresses some with and some without names) but no phone numbers. So how do I sync, or export and then import ALL my contacts?

1	Is it possible to play sound in mono?	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich cyanogenmod audio	I'm in a workplace that only allows one headphone in. This makes some music pretty awful, only having one channel. I'd like to mix my audio into one channel, but this seems to be a bit more difficult than you would expect. I don't want to buy a paid app, and I'm playing music from my Google Music library, so alternate players aren't an option. Is there any way to do this digitally? I don't want to have to buy an adapter and have it sticking out of my phone, risking my headphone jack, just to play mono. I'm on a Droid X2 running CM9. I know some of the manufacturer ROMs had mono options, but it's not in stock Android or CM9. 
1	How do I add a widget to my lock screen?	4.4-kitkat lock-screen-widgets nova-launcher	I am running a fully stock Android 4.4.4 Nexus 5, with Nova (Premium) Launcher. Since I first bought this device, I have heard, read, and been told that adding widgets to the lock screen is possible, as long as it is enabled in settings. Well, it is, but I can't figure out for the life of me how to actually add them. Sorry if this is a Super Newb question, I've Googled, Binged, etc... With no luck whatsoever. The only thing I seem to ever come across are instructions on how to enable them, which as I stated, I have done. 
1	When will my phone get the Android 2.2 update (FroYo)?	2.2-froyo updates	Android 2.2 (FroYo, short for "Frozen Yogurt") was released over the Summer 2010, however not all of the devices that will get this update have received it yet. Each manufacturer and carrier needs to add their custom modifications before it can be officially released. See also: When will my phone get the Android 2.3 update (Gingerbread)? 
1	Configure Play Store to download temporary files to SD Card	google-play-store updates insufficient-memory temp-files	I find that every time I start to update an application using Google Play, my phone's internal memory starts to run out (i.e. the Play app downloads temporary files to internal memory). In a number of cases, the size of the update is quite large and I end up with less than 10% free space left which corrupts the installers and I end up with no update. :( Is it possible to in any way instruct Google Play to use my SD card (which has over 10GB free space) as the temporary location instead of the space-constrained internal memory? As much as possible, I'd like to do this without having to root my device.

1	How to recover a System partition that won't mount	recovery-mode clockworkmod-recovery data-recovery samsung-galaxy-s-4-mini	A relative of mine brought me his Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9190 , which is stuck at boot. When I boot into recovery it gives the error Failed to mount /system (invalid argument) . How can I dig through the file-system of an android phone which doesn't boot, except in Recovery? The goal is not to flash it but to recover the data if possible. I don't mind rooting or flashing, but I don't want to overwrite the system partition that may still have the valuable info on it. I've managed to install clockworkmod according to these instructions . Is there a way to mount it, or expose the raw device to USB, or just back it up to SD, without overwriting it? EDIT: Now I have Clockworkmod installed. Trying to use it to make a backup of /system . It fails to mount /system with the message: mounting /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/b/system on /system failed: Invalid ArgumentW:failed to mount /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/system (File exists) EDIT 2: with ADB shell I looked into /system , found an empty folder called bin and removed it.

1	Is there any old style keyboard (numpad style) available for Android?	keyboard	I have a smaller screen Android Phone (LG Optimus One P500). Does anyone know whether there is a keyboard available for Android phones that has an "old phone" style? Like a numpad style? Here's an image example: The reason I'm asking for this style of keyboard is: This style uses only 12 buttons. So the buttons are large and very spaced out. You can click on them easily without having to strain your eyes too much. You can quickly keep clicking away without having to spell out each word because the dictionary will take care of that. So "moon" becomes 4 clicks on the numpad 6. How fast is that? I sure personally feel that lots of people are used to this kind of keyboard layout (from the times before Android became so popular). I don't understand why I can't find keyboards with this kind of a simple layout but I would be very grateful if someone could help me find an app like this. Edit: Forgot to mention. I'm not looking for paid apps right now but would consider it if they have a trial. 
1	How do I root Cruz Tablet?	google-play-store rooting	I am relatively new to the Android scene, and have recently bought my first official android-powered device. The cruz tablet was just $199 at Best Buy so I figured I culd give it a try. Unfortunately, it's very limited. I can live with the hardware shortcomings (no camera, no Bluetooth), but I want access to the full Android Market. I believe a rooting is in order. Can someone please point me in the direction of rooting instructions for this device? Is rooting the same for each Android device? I haven't found much info on the net about this particular tablet. Anything I can learn from here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!Thomas

1	Android 4.3 - No internet access, unable to connect to the proxy server error	proxy mobile-network 4.3-jelly-bean	My Lg nexus 4, received the android 4.3 update last night. I didn't do much on it, opting to sleep peacefully knowing that I had the latest and greatest in android software, but this morning I noticed that I cannot access the internet either via the web browser or the play market. Chrome complains "unable to connect to the proxy server" regardless of what site I try to go to. And the play store says "No connection". However, I do have a connection, I can use gmail to send and receive messages and I can use whatsapp and twitter and a few other apps. I have checked the network settings for both my 3G and wifi, and there are no proxy settings or anything enabled. Does anyone know what the problem might be? EDIT: Does this happen on both WiFi and mobile data? YES What apps have trouble, and which do work? Chrome and the play store as far as I can see are both troublesome. Other apps work i.e. my whatsapp can send/receive messages, twitter works and so on. What's the color of your signal bars in the notification area? Blue, full signal on HSDPA. EDIT 2:I think this may be affected by some setting left over from a rogue app. I have played with VPN apps and proxy setting apps in the past (a few months ago) so perhaps the new 4.3 update read some of those settings and configured things incorrectly? 
1	Can I empty the trash in the default e-mail app?	email	The POP e-mail account I use for mobile is linked to an externally-managed anti-spam gateway. It was starting to get too many false positives, so the other day I went through the web UI to mark a whole boatload of old messages as "not spam" to give it a nudge in the right direction. Of course, they all ended up back in the Inbox and subsequently got downloaded onto my phone. I deleted them, and now they're just sitting there in the trash. All 450 of them. I really don't want to have to delete every single message from the trash manually. After several minutes of digging on Google I've found genuinely ancient bug reports with no workarounds. Surely I'm just overlooking an obvious menu item somewhere and Google hasn't actually let such an obvious, gaping feature hole go unplugged for over 2 years, right? So where is it? How do I empty the trash? P.S. I'm aware of the fact that messages older than 30 days are supposed to be deleted automatically. That's not happening - possibly because they were already more than 30 days old when they were downloaded in the first place. P.P.S. Please do not tell me to use K9Mail or any other 3rd-party mail program. I'm sure they're great but any e-mail client that doesn't support Exchange ActiveSync is completely useless to me, and so far the only one I've found that seems to do it properly is the stock e-mail app. Sorry if this comes across as grouchy but I am absolutely sick of seeing this "solution" posted thoughtlessly to every single forum/thread I read that happens to mention a problem with e-mail.

1	How does Android get the coarse location?	geolocation	I read that android (and simmilar operation sytems e.g. iOS) get the current coarse location by using either WiFi or GSM tower triangulation. I get the basic idea but have questions about the details. Does Android normally use both methods or does it prefer one and fall back to the other? Does it comunicate with a server to get the position via WiFi? (e.g. sending the SIDs of the WiFis to a webservice) Does it communicate with the Carrier to get the position via the GSM towers or is this done on the device?

1	How to fix the infamous Nook Color / Nook Tablet charging USB cable for good?	hardware nook-color	The Barnes&amp;Noble Nook Color / Nook Tablet have a proprietary micro USB charging port which is longer than normal and allows power charging with 2Amps. The charging/data cable from BN is infamous to break after some time, most probably the cable's primary plastic coating is not very flexible and starts to split at the point where it enters the micro usb connector and leads to a visible secondary shielding. If nothing is done the situation worsens and in the end the internal power cables may short. I got my used B&amp;N Nook Color with a beginning coating split and cannot get a replacement from B&amp;N because I live outside the US and have no invoice. Seems like this problem is a common one, there are already discussions about a class action lawsuit. What can I do besides looking for a replacement?

1	How to connect your Nexus phone to a VGA projector?	external-display nexus-5 slimport	I would like to connect my Nexus 5 to an external projector or monitor. I know that there is a SlimPort to HDMI adapter (I have it), however, projectors and standard monitors still have VGA (and no HDMI) output. In addition to the SlimPort HDMI adapter by Analogix, I also bought the deleyCON HDMI to VGA adapter. The problem is that the external displays do not display any content (the SlimPort to HDMI cable is working, though). I also saw an SlimPort to VGA adapter from Analogix , but three customers say that it did not work either; see here for such a case. Has anyone succeeded in connecting the Nexus 4 or 5 to a VGA display? I note that How to use an Android phone or tablet to make a projector presentation? also addresses the problem. However, using a HDMI to VGA adapter (mentioned there as a possible solution) is not working. I am not sure if a real HDMI to VGA converter would be working, but they are typically bulky and I am wondering if there is a specific adapter to solve this problem.

I have ensured that I have selected to never sleep in advanced WiFi settings. I downloaded and experimented with the Wifi Keep Alive and REGPON wifi KeepAlive apps, but they have had no effect. I even tried rooting the device, and put on this ROM , in hopes that maybe some change would take effect, but it hasn't. Is this a known issue with the Galaxy Tab 10.1? I've done some Google searching and I've seen other people report it, but most fixes seem to just describe how to go into the advanced settings and enable "never" as an option. Is there any kind of fix I can apply? This is a somewhat critical feature for me, as I intend to be able to receive Skype calls, which can't be done if the WiFi disconnects.

I am looking for software that has all the features of iTunes. I have found a few that are loaded with ads and very few features. So far, I have not found any app that allows me to manage apps in terms of updates. Google could have an app that can handle the basic needs of an Android user. I have not been able to find this. Your help is appreciated. 
1	Not recieving messages from only one WhatsApp contact	notifications whatsapp-messenger motorola-photon	When I first met the love of my life, he insisted that we use WhatsApp to communicate. He lives in Brasil and uses WhatsApp on his Windows Phone. I'm in the United States and use WhatsApp for Android on my Motorola Photon Q. Over the past few months, our ability to communicate through this app has deteriorated. He says he receives my messages, and that he replies to them, but apparently I don't see them. This is frustrating, to say the least, and puts a lot of unneeded stress on both of us. I've worried myself sick over it. He says that I'm the only one this happens to, and that communication with his Brazilian contacts works just fine. One of my friends in the Philippines just got WhatsApp for Android and I can communicate with him perfectly. I'm really clueless. I've scoured the Internet for answers, but I can't seem to find any. I can send messages, and in the rare time that I do receive the messages from my boyfriend, it is late at night. I never receive any during the day. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app countless times, and my WiFi connection at my house is perfect. But this seems to only be getting worse. He says he sends me several messages a day, but I only get some of the messages about every other day--usually every two days. I'm not a tech by any means, but it seems like there might be something wrong with the different versions of WhatsApp. Android communicating with the Windows Phone. So if this is the case, then my question here is unneeded. I've contacted WhatsApp Inc. with my concerns and have yet to receive a reply. This sucks, to say the least. UPDATE: I have contacted one of my boyfriend's friends in Brasil. I can communicate with them perfectly. They said y boyfriend said there was an issue with his phone. But I'm not sure that's the case. I uninstalled WhatsApp and downloaded it through WhatsApp's website. I can now see when my boyfriend is online and when he types. But I do not receive the messag
1	Gmail app doesn't sync email at all when on Mobile Data	sync notifications gmail samsung-galaxy-s-3	I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I love the new Gmail app. Works awesome.

1	What information does stock Android send to Google by default, and how do I opt-out?	privacy	I'm about to buy my first Android phone. My understanding is that, in order to download apps and get updates from Google Play, I need to be permanently signed into a Google account that's linked to my name via credit card information. I find Google's privacy policy too ambiguous to understand what data is logged from Android users. I don't want to share more information than the device needs to operate. Here are some steps I plan to take already: Turn off Google Now Don't use Gmail Use a non-stock browser Use DuckDuckGo for search My questions: What other information does Android send to Google by default? What actions should I take to minimise data collection from Google and other apps? (I'll be using stock Android 4.2 on a Nexus 4.) Is Android still a good choice if I don't plan to use Google's services?

And if I don't notice, I can find myself out outside without battery power to do other things I need. Is there a way to permanently disable the exchange services, or even completely remove it from the device? 
1	Can't update apps nor install apps	google-play-store updates samsung-galaxy-nexus installation	I have a Galaxy Nexus with the stock firmware, it's a device that has been powered off for a long time. Currently I can't update any existing apps nor can I install new ones. I have tried with Chrome, Firefox Beta and Opera Mini, I also tried updating existing ones with no luck. Also there are apps that have updates available but Play Store doesn't offer the option to update (for example the version of Firefox is 16), others (actually just one) are listed as having available updates. There are two different behaviors that occur. When trying to install Chrome The Google Play says that the app is not compatible with the device, i don't think is the case. The same happens with Firefox which is listed as a supported device in the mozilla page When trying to update an app or install Opera Mini When trying to update an app with updates available or installing Opera Mini my device is recognized as supported but after clicking install and accepting the permissions an error occur, it says: Error retrieving information from server.

1	How risky is it to return a rooted android device under 'warranty'	root-access carriers warranty	A couple days ago I rooted my phone and I hard bricked it. I am debating whether or not to just send it in to get JTagged (for 50$) or to just try to get a new one under warranty. I have heard everything from: You can send a rooted phone back. Doesn't really matter. Returning Rooted Phones and I've returned a stock, rooted phone and even forgot to put the modded battery icon back to stock. No issues. ATT Detecting rooted phones? to: they can and do check. because they refurbish many of the returns for reuse. they can easily remove the rooted setup in favor of stock. but that isn't the point. its best to remove root with a restore if at all possible with the stock zv9 update. then the device is sent back in factory state. if you cant accomplish this due to issues with the device that prevent it,then you have to send it back as is. but the latter should always be the case to return it not restored. Returning Rooted Phones and not sure if they check that but if they did they can do anything from sue for fraud, since you lied. they can cancel your plan and ruin your esn. thats really about it. im not sure if they think its worth the hassle though. So what is the truth behind this? Is it risky to return a bricked/rooted phone to your carrier? Is it different for each carrier? (AT&amp;T, Verison, T-Mobile, ...) Are there any precautionary measurements out there people should take before they return a rooted device? Update: I received my new phone an
1	New nexus 7 tablet locks rotation - any way to reset without a reboot?	nexus-7 4.4-kitkat screen tablet auto-rotation	Since I updated my nexus 7 2013 to Android 4.4.2 I have an issue where my screen rotation is locked without any way to return it to normal (even after turning on/off the auto lock feature). Not sure if this is happening to a lot of people out there, but the only way to fix it is to turn the tablet off for a few seconds and turn it back on. My question is, is there a way to reset the rotation from a software perspective? Is There any service that I can start and stop. I need to make sure this is not hardware related and that possibly the best way to test it.

1	How can I clear the cache of the Android Facebook app?	facebook internal-storage 1.5-cupcake	My phone (T-Mobile Pulse/Huawei U8220 with Android 1.5) doesn't have much on board space, so I quite often run into the low disk space warning. Looking through the list of apps, I see the facebook app has about 2.5 MB of user data. I suspect most of this is a photo album I looked at recently. But I can't seem to find any option to clear that cache ... Does anyone know how to? I'm happy to use a file manager and go into the filesystem to delete stuff if I can find it and someone can reassure me that I'm not going to stuff up the facebook app at the same time. And I don't want to uninstall and reinstall because nothing will install any more . 
1	How to backup&restore Android device?	backup 4.2-jelly-bean	i have a new Nexus 4 (i.e. Jellybean 4.2.1), and i want to backup my current Nexus 4 and restore it onto the new Nexus 4. How can i do that? i've tried going into Settings -> Backup &amp; reset -> Back up my data to ensure my phone is backed up. When the new device is first setup it automatically tries to restore settings from Google's Servers: Screenshot (click image to enlarge) Except that not everything was restored. Amongst the things that are not restored are: applications are not restored (a new version is downloaded from the store) application settings are not restored pictures, videos, camera, videos, saved files are not restored wallaper is not restored unlock pattern is not restored preferences are not restored icon layout is not restored Messaging conversations are not restored Talk conversation history is not restored recent calls are not restored custom ringtones are not restored custom notification sounds are not restored i've tried downloading an application called App Backup &amp; Restore . But because there is no external storage on the Nexus 4, there is no way to copy the backup off the phone. Also, App Backup &amp; Restore cannot backup app settings for me. From the web-site: Notice: App Backup cannot backup data or settings of apps for you Neither can <s
1	Can I pair 2 Android Devices via Bluetooth for internet access?	wifi-tethering bluetooth-tethering	This is pretty much hypothetical at this point but I'm curious...Let's say I get one of the Android tablets likely to be coming out in the spring and get one that only has WiFi and no WWAN access built in...I've got a Moto Droid running stock 2.2.1 and unrooted. I know I can obviously tether via wifi if I root the device, but there is also the application PDANet that allows you to tether with your computer via USB or Bluetooth. USB is probably out of the question on most tablets, but is there any way that I would be able to tether the phone to the tablet via Bluetooth? From what I've read, PDANet uses the DUN (Dial Up Networking) BT profile for tethering, which Android can obviously host, but is there any support in android for BT DUN client mode? In all likelyhood I will just root (again actually... CyanogenMod almost bricked my phone) and go with that... but I'm also trying to look to the future when I will hopefully replace the Droid next summer and I don't want to become used to WiFi tethering, and then have no option upon purchasing a new phone unless I make sure that whatever I get can be rooted and run wifi-tether.

1	Problem connecting Nexus 7 as mass storage device on Windows 7	usb windows nexus-7 usb-mass-storage	I have an Asus Nexus 7 tablet, and was trying to connecting it in MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) mode to my Samsung Series 5 laptop running Windows 7 SP1 Home Premium Edition. I have a bunch of Android development tools installed also, and typically have my devices connected using the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) driver. When I first attempted to connect my Nexus 7 to my laptop to use in MTP mode, it simply refused to show up in Windows Explorer . Finally, I figured out that I had to uninstall the ADB device ("Android Phone") from Device Manager and then it would work correctly in MTP mode. Any ideas why this is? Is MTP mode trumped by the ADB USB Driver? Note : I always had USB Debugging disabled on the Nexus 7, so it wasn't that.

1	Using ADB with usb debugging disabled, and no root	wi-fi adb locked-out	I have an Android Device running Android 2.3.7 . The device is locked due to exceeding pattern attempts. So now Android is prompting me to enter my gmail id and password. The problem is, the WiFi is turned off and the Data is turned off. I have found using this thread that you it is possible to turn on wifi using ADB. But on my device, even usb debugging is not turned on. So, I cannot access the device using adb. So, I figured may be you can access device using adb in recovery mode ( my phone is not rooted ). But so far, in recovery mode, running adb devices does not list my device. Is it possible to access a device using adb if your usb debugging is turned off ( on a non rooted phone ) ? How about in recovery mode ?

1	How can I boost the volume on my Droid's speaker?	motorola-droid volume-control	I used to have an app for my Treo called "Volume Care" that let me boost the volume of my speaker beyond what the factory settings allowed. Is there any app or hack that would allow me to push my Droids speaker further than Motorola wants to allow? Edit: I thought I was clear before, but let me clarify. I am not looking for just any volume control app , I have one, I know of many, and believe it or not I am capable of searching the market for the word "volume." I am specifically looking for a solution that will allow me to push the volume out of my speaker past that current manufacturer set limits. Update: I just added a bounty so I'll add a bit more clarification. I have seen apps out there that work with HTC phones only. This solution/app/hack must work on the Original Moto Droid rooted or not, I want a noticeable increase in the volume.

When I call the entered number, I get the typical Verizon lady saying "The call cannot be completed as dialed..." I specifically have used a code from this link (this addresses the problem I am having) and have tried multiple others from here *, but all give that same problem. Is there something that I am missing? Do I have to be a super user or something along those lines? *Note: I know these may not be specific to my device, but some of these look to be universal regardless of manufacturer or model.

On my iPhone this pops up after selecting text, but I cannot even select the text on Android. The whole process is so intuitive on iOS I cannot even remember how I do it, it just happens naturally. On Android I can't work it out! I'm mostly interested in version 4.2.2 and the multi-line plain text input used on the Wordpress app, though I have equal trouble with Notes and Chrome's address bar. I want to occasionally move sentences around within a chunk of text, without duplicating them (so Copy is of limited interest, though I note it is equally difficult). I have a Sony XPeria Z1. NOTE: this question is about cutting, not copying. Thanks.

For the real problem, I have downloaded an app around ~40MB in size from Google Play (with ~50MB free internal memory). However, the app was not installed due to "insufficient memory". I decided to ignore it, but when I checked my internal memory's space, it was reduced to just ~8MB only, without even the installed app. I have set my default install location to SD card using ADB before I downloaded the said app. Can you tell me what happened here? Is it that the downloaded app resides in internal memory and I have to delete it? if so, please teach me how.

To clarify - there is nothing wrong with 3G or EDGE on her phone, since she can browse the internet and use other such apps perfectly fine. Update - She's on Vodafone, as I and thousands of people in India are, and no, Vodafone is not blocking Whatsapp for any reason. Searching for solutions on Google only leads to 'No shit, Sherlock!' type answers with genius level solutions like 'check whether your 3G connection is working' or 'get the latest version of Whatsapp'. So is there a workaround?

1	How can I reduce screen brightness below the minimum without an app?	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich cyanogenmod root-access screen-brightness	I have an Optimus Elite, and it has a minimum brightness setting. In certain apps, I can reduce the brightness below the safe minimum, but when I leave the app, the brightness is increased to the system-wide minimum. Using RootDim , I can permanently set the brightness below the safe amount, and it will stay even after going to other apps. Or using Screen Filter , I can accomplish almost the same thing even without needing root (it displays a translucent 'filter' over the whole screen, reducing brightness/contrast but not actually changing the backlighting power amount). What I want to know is where the minimum screen brightness is stored. I have a rooted phone with CyanogenMod 9, so I have permissions to edit anything and could change a config or sqlite entry, but I don't know where this value is stored. What I would like to do is use the status bar brightness slider to be able to slide to the actual minimum of the screen, rather than the OS-controlled minimum. Having an app is useful, but having the functionality without the app seems to be within reach, if only I knew where the OS is getting it's safe minimum setting. Where is this "safe minimum brightness" setting stored? If I can change it, I can remove my apps and use native controls. 
1	Is there any way to check the backup that android does?	backup adb	Today I have been researching a bit about the Android backup options (Since I have seen some people having to lose all their data due to ICS serious bugs). From now, I prefer to use native options, such like the "default" option or the adb backup -all command. But my question regards to the regular way. It's to say, I enable the Settings->Backup->Backup my data option (on ICS). Now I would like to check on my google account preferences when the data was last backed up and maybe what data is safe. I'm not sure if that's possible, but does anyobody know it?

1	How to prevent apps running in background	task-management	 Possible Duplicate: How can I stop applications and services from running? i've an Xperia X10 Mini. This Android devices is limited in hardware: a 600Mhz processor and 128 mb ram. So i'd like to install new apps, but i don't like to have a lot of apps running in background. For example, Facebook app, GDrive, Dropbox ... are great, but why 'damn' thei must run in background either if i don't want to use them at the moment ? This cause my device to run slowly, very slowly... I know that facebook app for example, 'must' stay in background so it can inform me for a new 'friend post' .. but i don't need it! Also Gdrive, Dropbox, Gmail etc: they 'must' stay in background to inform me for something.. but i'm not interested !!! If i want to check mail... i click to gmail.. if i want to check my friend post... i click facebook ! What i want is a responsive smartphone for basic operation (call, sms etc.), and i'm sure a 600mhz processor with a basic 'android' installation and without background app can go fast as a double core Arm with 100 running app !!!! So, at the moment i disinstall them, and my device back to run good, with no slowdowns. I also have installed Advanced Task Killer, but it kills apps each hour, or 30minutes: it don't prevent an app to run in background. Does exists an app that kill others app each time they start in background, immediately ?

1	Use SD card (or part of it) as internal storage	cyanogenmod external-sd insufficient-memory app2sd	I recently rooted and installed CyanogenMod 10 on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7" tablet. My main purpose for doing this was to get rid of the bloatware that came with it so I could have more apps because I was running out of space. However, after installing even fewer apps than I had pre-root, I'm getting insufficient storage error. I'm guessing there are a couple of solutions for this. I probably have something taking up space that I'm unaware of that can/needs to be removed. There may also be an option to use the SD card as "internal storage"? How do I identify the root of the problem and fix it?

To be more specific, I really do not need to move the app itself, only the mail storage so if there is a way to move the storage location of mails from the internal memory to the SD card I would be very interested to know how that is done.

1	Samsung Galaxy S: phone won't send or receive calls and text messages	2.2-froyo samsung-galaxy-s sms calls	I own a rooted Samsung Galaxy S, running 2.2 Froyo. My service provider is AT&amp;T. Every so often, around about once a week to once a month, my phone will unexpectedly, without warning, enter a state where it refuses to send or receive text messages and phone calls. The only way I've found to get my phone to work normally again is by rebooting. Specifically, if I try sending a text message, it just says sending but never actually seems to send anything. I don't receive any text messages at all (and when I turn my phone back on, I might receive several at once that were sent over an hour ago). I don't receive any phone calls. When I try calling somebody, I don't hear the 'ringing noise', and the phone attempts to call endlessly without actually doing so. If I give up, and try clicking the red 'End Call' button, it does return me to the homescreen but displays the phone symbol in the notification bar. If I slide the notification tray down, it has a sort of green 'in-progress' calling thing with a few buttons to mute or end the call. Attempting to end the call does absolutely nothing, and the 'call in-progress' thing is stuck there until I reboot. However, the internet (both wifi and 3G) both seem to work. I'm not sure exactly what causes this issue, or precisely how frequently this occurs. Since I only notice when I need to call somebody or am expecting a call, I suppose it's entirely possible that this issue occurs more frequently then I notice and just as silently resolves itself (although I have no idea how to check this). I've tried searching on the internet, but wasn't able to find anything useful. Can somebody identify what's wrong with my phone, or help me diagnose the issue? Edit: Here's my logcat and here's the output I

1	Email won't stay deleted	email	I mostly use my computer for email, but obviously when I'm on the go it's good to have my email accessible at all times. That's what the email app is for, right? So I have it set up to download emails, but to never delete them from the server. Essentially this is the same as I have on my laptop. Only my main computer is set to delete emails from the server when I delete them from my inbox. The point is, while this works fine on my laptop, my phone will keep downloading the same emails, even when I hit the "Delete" button to remove them from my phone's inbox. Strangely, though, it will only do this a few hours after they were deleted (the mailbox is set to update every 15 minutes), and usually only when I receive a new email or two. In other words, when I get a new email, the phone will start downloading some old emails seemingly at random. What gives, and how do I fix it?

1	SD card will not format within Android therefore cannot mount. Works fine on laptop	samsung-galaxy-s-3 external-sd encryption formatting	I bought a 64GB SD card for my Galaxy S3, and it worked perfectly. Today I turned on device encryption (worked fine) then I turned on SD card encryption. Since then I am stuck with the phone reporting that the SD card is blank or has an unsupported file system. Android gives me the option to format. The screen displays it is erasing, but then nothing happens. I have tried removing the SD card and turning the phone on and off again. I have manually formatted the card using Windows 7 (ExFAT file system). I am able to read and write files to the card on the computer but the phone refuses to acknowledge a mountable SD Card. I have also tried turning off the SD card encryption. Any ideas on a fix?

How can I go about restoring these photos from the internal memory. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks! 
1	Block all sounds going out through speaker when headphone connected	audio headphones samsung-galaxy-551 speakerphone	I'm kind of new in Android and I realized that all the sounds are going out through the speaker regardless if the headphones are connected.

Summarizing the problem are: phone calls, notifications and some "random" apps.

1	What is JTAG in regards to Android?	usb hardware unbricking	I see the term JTAG used for reviving dead Android devices that otherwise don't respond to anything and aren't seen when USB connected. It seems that it's something done from the physical hardware side of the device (as opposed to some pure software based solution) and I've heard the term used elsewhere (in gaming consoles). I don't find much else about it, and I'd like to know specifically how it relates to Androids and similar devices. It seems to be a term in electronics or electrical engineering, both of which I am unfamiliar with. I'm wondering what it is and why it can be used on hard bricked devices.

1	Disable or prompt VoIP calling on Android Whatsapp	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich whatsapp-messenger voip	I recently updated my Whatsapp on Android. I noticed that it allows voice calls with the new version. There is a contact that resides in the same city as me that I would like to place a call to. However, Whatsapp doesn't give me the option of making a normal call when I press the call button from within whatsapp, rather than Internet call. I would have to exit the app and call with the normal phone app. Is there an option to disable this or at least prompt which app to use? I appreciate that Whatsapp coming up with new initiatives, but please allow users choose between Internet or carrier call. Is there a new version that allows this or do I have to wait for it?

1	Instagram creates a new "Camera" folder, how do I deal with it?	2.3-gingerbread camera gallery instagram	I'm on Android 2.3.4, Xperia Active. And I have downloaded and installed Instagram. Normally when I take pictures on the stock Camera app, my photos gets sent to sdcard/DCIM/100ANDRO . However, when I installed Instagram and started to use it, I notice that it created a new folder under sdcard/DCIM and called it Camera and that is where it places the pictures I take inside the app. What's worse is that, aside from creating the sdcard/DCIM/Camera folder, it also creates the same image inside sdcard/DCIM/100ANDRO . So whenever I take an Instagram photo, that picture gets 2 copies plus the third one with the applied filters on a separate folder called Instagram . This may not have been an issue because I can always clear the sdcard/DCIM/Camera folder every after some time. But the thing is, it's showing up on my Gallery app as two Camera folders. I thought I fixed it when I placed a .nomedia file inside the Instagram-created Camera folder. Sure, after I force reload the Gallery app, it will hide sdcard/DCIM/Camera then. But when I take another photo on Instagram, it resurfaces on the Gallery app again. This time, it only shows the latest taken picture as viewable. And the old contents are shown as broken images (see the one hilited in yellow below). Sure enough when I force reload the Gallery app, it hides again but I don't want to have to force reload it each and every time. I know that this is just a simple problem for some but I'm really not too pleased to see duplicates of the same image showing up. I'm really sorry for the lengthy post

I got word that the Nexus 10 also lack this option, but I can't find any info as to why that is. Anybody have anything to share?

1	Missing internal flash memory and SD card does not mount	storage archos-gen8	Some time ago I installed a custom firmware ( YAR28 ) on my Archos 7HT. This worked fine for a while, until some day when I switched it on it showed the initial startup screen, and after that all my installed apps were gone. So I re-installed the stock firmware from Archos. But then I found out I could no longer access the sd-card. It was not mounted when I inserted it. But when I connected the device to my PC using USB it did show up as drive F: and G:. I could access F:, which was obviously my sd-card, but G: (which should be the internal flash) could not be accessed, and Windows even asked if this should be formatted. When I open the Files on my tablet, and select 'SD Card' it gives the 'SD card is unmounted' error. And when I select 'Internal Memory' it is completely empty. So it looks like the file system is still working, but the internal flash part somehow is no longer accessible. I have a feeling that some low level setting has changed and that I could somehow solve it if I could get access to the underlying Linux system, but I do not have a clue how to proceed. 
1	My WiFi status icon on 4.1 is grey, even when the connection is working fine. Why?	wi-fi cyanogenmod 4.1-jelly-bean notification-icons	I just switched from AOKP to the latest CyanogenMod M-build, and I'm noticing that my WiFi and 3G/H+ icons never switch to blue. This is a bit annoying as usually the grey WiFi icon is an indication that the WiFi I'm connected to isn't actually letting me out onto the Internet, but now they seem to stay grey all the time. Is there anything I can do to troubleshoot this issue? Is it a known bug? What does the grey icon really mean? I've tried looking around the sync settings as there are some indications this might have something to do with the device not being able to contact the Google servers to sync, but sync is working fine and I'm having no real problems except the fact that it's annoying that the icon is indicating what I've previously interpreted as a problem. edit It seems that there is an actual problem aside from the cosmetic one: in Google Talk I am completely offline, I get my contact list but it's greyed out. I also don't get notifications from the Gmail app when new mail arrives. edit2 This was solved by simply removing CM10 and going back to AOKP. I did a full wipe before every install, either this is a bug in CM10 or it's an issue caused by my Titanium backups. Not sure, but the backups worked fine with AOKP.

1	Why won't JRD MMITest go away?	applications	This app (which doesn't actually appear to exist on my phone) keeps popping up randomly on my phone. Its called JRD MMITest and seems to want to test the functionality of the phone. It covers such tests as accelerometer, touch screen, radio, speaker, bluetooth, wifi, etc but all of that works fine without the app even testing for it. In what I suspect is a related issue, certain phone features have also turned off from time to time... Auto Rotation being one of them and I noticed my Play Store app's data had suddenly been restricted on wifi. I have since corrected these issues with no further anomalies becoming evident as yet. My phone is a Vodafone Smart 4 Mini (Model Number 785) running Android Jellybean 4.2.2. I've completed the testing successfully and restarted the phone under the impression that this would prevent it from coming up again. (as per Annoying MMI test on Alcatel one touch evolve? ) however the app keeps coming up randomly. I don't know what else to do here, does anyone have any suggestions?

1	Nexus 7 wont boot after complete discharge	battery nexus-7 power-on	I accidentally let the battery on my Nexus 7 run completely empty, and now it won't start up anymore even after charging overnight. How can I make it work again? This is what happened in detail: My battery ran low, and I had no time to recharge it. I forgot about it, and found my tablet powered off. I attached it to a charger (the official wall-plug adaptor), waited a few minutes, and then turned it on. I expected it to be able to run from the cable like my phone, but it reported 0% battery and shut itself down immediately. I retried it after a slightly longer time. This time I didn't get to the home screen, but was shown a black and white animated battery icon. I pressed the power button, and the animation froze, and only disappeard after a long time (I put it away and discovered it was gone after a few hours). Since then I've been loading it for > 12 hours, but I haven't been able to get any response. The charger gets warm, but the tablet doesn't. I've heard that once the battery is competely discharged, it only charges in "trickle mode" (that is normally used to top off a 98% loaded battery safely), and can take a very long time to become operative again. This would explain why the adapter gets warm but not the tablet. If this is true, is there any way to speed up charging? 
1	How to install a ROM with CWM when /data (and /sdcard) are encrypted and I can't reformat them?	samsung-galaxy-s-3 rom-flashing clockworkmod-recovery rom unbricking	I used to run CyanogenMod 9.1 with device encryption on my Galaxy S3, and decided today that I wanted to try a CM 10 nightly. A problem with device encryption that I didn't know about before is that it's impossible to turn off. ClockworkMod Recovery (5.8.4.3) can't mount the /data partition (and, by extension, /sdcard ). This means that I can't use CWM to factory reset or install a new update.zip, since the update.zip must lie on the internal sdcard. Trying "choose zip from sdcard" gives "E:Can't mount /sdcard/" and choosing "apply /sdcard/update.zip" gives "E:Can't mount /sdcard/update.zip". This happens even if I've used adb to put the update.zip in the /sdcard mountpoint. Factory resetting from CWM gives these two errors: "Error mounting /data!" and "Error mounting /sdcard/.android_secure!". Factory resetting from CM9 didn't work. I've since tried to flash CM10 with MobileOdin, which didn't work, and now I can only boot to CWM. Does anyone have any idea about how I could mount /data or otherwise get a working ROM? I've taken backups of everything. The tools I suppose could help me, but I haven't tried because I'm new at this and don't want to hard-brick my phone, are fastboot and heimdall. TL;DR: S3 only boots to CWM, but CWM won't mount /data and so can't flash zips.

1	Sharing files between users in 4.2.1	file-system 4.2-jelly-bean multi-user	I have a Google Nexus 7, unrooted, running stock 4.2.1. I have set it up for two user and we seems to be enjoying it. Recently I ran into an issue about sharing files. In User1's account I copied few PDFs into \sdcard\PDFs folder and was able to use it well. When I switched to User2's account, I could not see the folder \sdcard\PDFs at all. Surprisingly, I could not see it even when through computer when Nexus 7 is connected as Portable media player. I guess this can be achieved by granting sufficient access by escalating to root, which needs rooted device - but I am not sure. My questions: Are there any way I can share files between users of the same tablet without using Internet (like using email, dropbox etc) or transferring to some repository like PC etc? If I root, can I change the permission to such user created folders and access files from other user's account or elevating as root? Update: Found a link that asks same question - but the answer given is not applicable for files rather works for apps, not useful. 
1	How do you skip the PIN to go directly to the camera from the lock screen?	lock-screens camera	I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 with Android 4.1.2 (standard, not rooted). I previously had an iPhone, and the feature I miss the most is the ability to go directly to the camera from the lock screen without having to type in my PIN. How do I do this on Android? I know that there are at least two or three questions asking pretty much the same question. Unfortunately, I don't have the reputation to comment on those answers to explain why they don't help me: Is it possible to use the camera without unlocking first? : How to enable a PIN but allow quick access to camera? For both of these posts, the accepted answers recommend WidgetLocker, but the persons who gave the answers had apparently never tried it themselves. I've tried at least five different free lock screen apps, but none of them solve my problem--they all still require a PIN to use the camera. I haven't tried WidgetLocker, but I'm not going to pay for an app that I'm not sure will work, especially when all the others I've tried don't work. Does anyone know for sure that WidgetLocker resolves this problem? I also bought and tried WidgetLocker, but it doesn't support PINs at all, and so it is not a solution to this problem. How to use camera without unlocking phone? (Jelly Bean on S3) : This answer suggests using Samsung's built in motion. I tried this, and it still requires the PIN to access the camera. This answer doesn't resolve the issue. I'm certainly willing to pay for an app that solves this issue, but I don't need any other lock screen features--I just want rapid access

1	Disabling smiley key on keyboards with the stock messaging app in ICS	sms 4.0-ice-cream-sandwich keyboard customization	I'm using a custom ROM for ICS on my Samsung Galaxy S. I like being able to create a new line in a text message, but the 'enter' key on all keyboards I use (though primarily Swype) is replaced with a 'smiley' key. Is there any way to change this behaviour? Some research shows me it's to do with the field type used in the messaging app. Can the MMS.apk package be modified to use a different field type, or is it possible to modify Swype so that the 'enter' key is used instead? I'm aware that I could use a 3rd party messaging app, but I like the stock app. I know some people are happy to send multiple messages in bursts rather than a long message with new lines but I'd find that annoying to receive and I don't want to annoy people I text.

1	Smart lock not working anymore with trusted places	5.0-lollipop location-services smart-lock	I have used smart lock with trusted places since it arrived and it has been working fine. Without any noticable changes, it has stopped working. My location shows in maps as exactly where I am, but being at one of my trusted places still makes me type my pass key. I have tried toggling location, accuracy, rebooted phone etc but with no luck. Any ideas on how to fix this?

1	Will constantly having Bluetooth on drain my battery too fast?	bluetooth battery-life	I'm thinking about making an app which will require Bluetooth to be available at all times.

1	How can I change language for word suggestion while writing an sms text message	sms languages	I will be extremely disappointed if there is no way to change language WHILE writing an SMS without having to go to the phone's settings and changing the language there.

1	Extract App Data from Nandroid / CWM Backup	clockworkmod-recovery data-recovery restore nandroid	I use ClockworkMod Recovery, and Slimbean. Recently, my slimbean started hanging at the loading screen and getting insanely hot. So I took a backup, and cleaned flashed AOKP rom. It's working fine so far. Initially, I tried to do a flash without clearing data. Then, a clean flash with "advanced restore"ing the data alone from the backup, but both resulted in the above-mentioned problem of hanging at boot screen. Is there a way to extract the app-data from CWM backup and restore it manually? Or an app for this? 
1	Too little memory in Android NAND ROMs. Cannot install apps!	storage htc-hd2	(I was about to ask it here, but since I found the answer I'll share it too) After installing Android on NAND on my HD2, I found that the available system memory is too little for everyday use. It's around 180MB and after a few applications I need to move everything (manually) to SD card. I would like to have more space for system, especially if I have a large (say, 8GB) SD card.

1	Samsung Galaxy S3 keeps losing network connection and need to restart phone to reconnect	samsung-galaxy-s-3 mobile-network	I've had my S3 for around 6 months and never had a problem. But in the last couple of days it seems to be randomly losing connection to network (T-Mobile): I have to restart my phone to reconnect. Sometimes this only lasts a few minutes before dropping out again. Anybody else had this problem? I have no idea whats causing it. I have changed nothing on the phone, and the area I am in has good coverage. I dont get any error msg and all seems fine -- until I try to use it to access Internet; then it tells me "no internet connection" and the internet data signal disappears. If I try to text the text just fails to send, and I cannot receive or make any calls. People who ring say it goes straight to the mailbox.

1	Can't switch/close tabs in the Chrome browser on my Android tablet	chrome-for-android	I just recently purchased a cheap tablet (DigiLand DL701Q 8gb), as my first foray into Android. I've been using the pre-installed Chrome browser but I can't figure out how to switch tabs or close them. I've searched for hours and all I could find was that the little square icon with numbers in the top right is the tool for tabs, but tapping it does nothing. I've tried double/triple tapping and swiping, but it still does nothing. Tapping and holding on it opens a popup message with the phrase "open tabs" but tapping that also has no function. I've tried every combination and method I can think of, but nothing works. Only one time did I manage to switch to a different tab and then quickly close it, but this was a result of me desperately mashing the square icon in frustration and I haven't been able to replicate it. I currently have 7 tabs open and I have no idea what they are or how to view them or how to close them. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I listed my specific carrier's model in the question because that's important , however the CW post for rooting states there should only be one question per model, so answers for other versions of the GS5 are appropriate answers for this question, they just won't be marked as answer from me. I haven't been able to find solid information for rooting the Samsung Galaxy S5, has anyone had experience with rooting this model?

1	Facebook contact sync in Ice Cream Sandwich	contacts sync 4.0-ice-cream-sandwich facebook	The rivalry between Google and Facebook seems to have gotten in the way of a really useful feature from Gingerbread: Facebook contact sync. Currently my Verizon Galaxy Nexus has the ability to add accounts for Google, Twitter, LinkedIn. There is even a Facebook entry in the add account list. However, clicking that does nothing. I see that in 4.0.3 there are new social contacts APIs that will let 3rd parties extend this feature with checkins and posts . Is there a way to enable Facebook contact syncing in ICS (with or without 4.0.3)?

1	"Android OS" is continuously downloading something in the background, how can I stop that?	data-traffic background-data	My HTC One V (on 4.0 ICS) seems to be continuously downloading something even when it's inactive, and it's using the battery abnormally fast. My data usage graph: (click to enlarge) On the first picture, the brown line is for the "Android OS" element, which as you can see is responsible for at least 60% of the data consumption. I don't know what Android is downloading, but it does it continuously and it has a big effect on my battery's life. When I disable mobile data, the battery usage line becomes flat (see second picture). How can I check what exactly "Android OS" is doing? And how can I disable this activity? Here is the battery usage graph. As you can see, the line became flat when I've disabled mobile data. (click to enlarge)

1	Move paid apps between devices?	google-play-store paid-apps	I have an android phone(1) on 2.3.3 and a tablet(2) on preorder that will be on 3. (And a bad gadget habit.) Can I, when the tablet arrives, uninstall paid apps on the phone and install them on the tablet? It feels like I should be able to since I've paid for a copy of the app linked to that Google account it shouldn't matter which linked device it's on. (Why? Some stuff I've paid for will look better/be more useful on the tablet.) I've looked online, but most people are asking about moving paid apps from broken phones (ie when they can't uninstall from the first device) or trying to run the same paid app on multiple devices which is piracy/cheap.

I haven't been able to find the option anywhere, and it is recommended to free up memory, which is short in this phone. Could it be that I can't do a "Factory data reset" on this model?

1	Facebook Messenger always crashing	crashes facebook-messenger	I have a Dell Venue 8 tablet with Android 4.4.2. Today the Facebook Messenger application started to crash whenever I try to open it. The crash doesn't happen in my phone (a Moto G running Android 4.4.4 and the same version of the FB messenger). From what I understand, libhoudini.so is the ARM emulation layer (this tablet is a x86 device). No other apps (not even the main Facebook app) seem to present the problem. I tried cleaning its cache/data and uninstalling/reinstalling it but didn't work. What else besides resetting the device can I try?

1	The Mystery Of The Disappearing App Icons	applications 2.3-gingerbread home-screen-shortcuts lg-optimus-one	If I try to rearrange the shortcuts to app icons on my homescreen, sometimes they disappear. It happens to all apps, bookmarks, and folders, too: even stock apps, like Play Store. I have an LG optimus s that I got about a year ago, new. I'm running 2.3.3. Gingerbread.Details : app icons often reappear in folders after reboot, sometimes without reboot. I'll say again, for clarity, that this only happens when I attempt to rearrange the icons : no spontaneous disappearances! I use my phone almost 24/7, as I do not own a tablet or a computer with wifi, so I like everything to be in it's place. 
1	Android mail client not deleting emails on IMAP server	samsung-galaxy-s-2 sync email imap	I have a new Samsung Galaxy S2 SkyRocket and the native mail program doesn't delete my IMAP mail from my server. When I view my mail on my PC, I'm still seeing the emails I deleted on the phone. The Samsung tech told me I needed to uncheck the "Leave a copy on server" option in my mail client on my PC; however, Thunderbird 12.0.1 doesn't have that option (and personally, I fail to see how that has anything to do with my phone's mail client.) Does anyone have an idea on how to set my phone so that it deletes those emails? Thanks!

1	How do I disable full-screen mode in Chrome for Android?	chrome-for-android	Some time ago, both Chrome and Chrome Beta started going full-screen. That is, I no longer see my status bar.

1	How can I remote support an Android tablet?	tablet remote-access	My mother is considering to get an Android tablet - probably a Nexus 7 or 10. Because I don't live near her, I might need to provide some remote assistance -- and you probably know that talking her through things on the phone is not very efficient, especially when I can't actually see what's on her screen. I don't want to access the file system, read SMS messages, download photos, etc. I just want to see what she sees so that I can talk her through whatever she needs help with. Is there an Android equivalent of running a VNC server so that I can see the exact screen my mom is currently seeing? The "VNC server" apps I've seen in the Play Store are more like remote desktop apps and they all seem to require to launch an app from the device -- then you can see Android on your pc but not on the device which wouldn't help my mom. Is it possible to do some kind of screen-sharing on Android, similar to a PC running VNC? Could this work via a PC (Windows, Linux), or would I need another Android device, or perhaps even an identical Android tablet?

1	Samsung Galaxy S2 Problems - Possibly Hardware Related?	samsung-galaxy-s-2 hardware system-freeze	I've had my Galaxy S2 SGH-I777 (AT&amp;T) for about 2 months now and everything has been great up until yesterday. I started experiencing some freezing and strange behavior. The phone is unrooted and using the stock ROM. The problems include but are not limited to: Random freezing when the phone is locked (by pressing the power button). Always have to do a hard reset. Random notifications about MTP initialization when no USB cable has been plugged into the phone. Vlingo Voice command (come preloaded on the phone) randomly popping up/starting without anything being pressed. Sometimes when I power off the phone it doesn't actually turn off completely but just restarts. Plugging in the USB cable while the phone is off turns it on (I don't think this is default behavior). And just recently I've had some strange touchscreen issues. Random letters being typed that I haven't touched etc. These issues are not constant but occur intermittently. I've already performed a factory reset, but the problems persist. Since I have yet to read about anyone else having similar problems with their phones, this leads me to believe that it's not actually an issue with the stock ROM but an issue with the phone itself and the hardware. But before I take it back to AT&amp;T I wanted to get some input from you guys. Any ideas on what could be causing this? Thanks in advance. 
1	What is causing music playback to stop/pause unexpectedly?	2.2-froyo music music-player motorola-droid	Moto DROID v1Android 2.2.1 Is anyone else experiencing random music playback stopping/pausing on their handset? Do you know what is causing it, or how to prevent it? I've been trying to get to the root of the issue, and I think it has to do with the music playback service. I've tried several apps (stock Music app, DoubleTwist, Cubed (3)). In each case the behavior is the same. Seemingly at random, and with now obvious trigger, music playback will pause/stop. I've seen this both with and without bluetooth, wifi, Last.FM scrobbling, and headphones. It does not correlate to notifications, as I get e-mail, text, and other notifications and playback continues. My music files are stored on the MicroSD card. Could this be due to latency in loading a portion of a file? 
1	Problems accessing message logs on Jelly Bean with aLogcat	4.1-jelly-bean logging nexus-7 k9-mail	 Summary I have been having problems accessing the K9 log messages using aLogcat, see below for more details. What I would like to know is: Why are no log messages from K9 appearing in the aLogcat log viewer? Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can see the full text of the errors which are occurring when trying to sync my K9 folders? Could something have changed in Jelly Bean which lead K9's logging to stop working? Since there seem to be remarkably few messages being shown by aLogcat in general, has something has changed in Jelly Bean which could mean that it is no longer able to access all messages? Detail I have recently been having connection problems with K9. My folders fail to sync and the folder list ends up full of socket errors ( libcore.io.ErrnoException: ) or ssl errors ( javex.net.ssl.SSLException: ) etc. where the last checked time should be. I get different messages depending on which problem is occurring at the time, but I can't see the full text of the error message, so it's difficult to guess what the cause might be. Thinking that the log files might contain more information, I followed the instructions at Recording a debug log , enabled debug logging in K9, installed aLogcat and tried to look at the logs. Sadly, whichever log buffer I select ( Main , Events or Radio ), there appear to be no messages from K9. If I add the suggested (k9|AndroidRuntime) regex filter then I see nothing in any of the logs. If I remove it then Main contains mostly garbage collection messages, Events seem to contain mostly messages from aLogcat itself and I haven't seen a log message in Radio yet. If it makes any difference, I'm using a Nexus 7

1	Stop Galaxy S2 from reading homepages out loud?	samsung-galaxy-s-2 text-to-speech	My Galaxy S2 has suddenly started reading all homepages out loud, and it is really annoying. Does anyone know how to stop it? I am running the new ICS software. Update When the computer voice is reading out loud, it seems that I can turn down the volume of that voice, which mitigates the problem for now. Also, it seems that it is only the browser and the facebook apps for which everything is read out loud. Update again In Settings -> Applications -> Running I see a "Voice commands", and under that the Samsung TTS process is running. When I force close that one, a voice says "driving mode off". However, the process is relaunched immediately again. Seems the suggestion about disabling driving mode is the way to go, however I cannot find any such option anywhere in the settings menu. Update again again This is getting pretty weird. I managed to disable driving mode. You can do that by going to the voice command app by double tapping the "home" button. However, that did not help, it is still reading all homepages out loud. Any help please, it would be very much appreciated? 
1	Android Tethering DNS Problem	2.3-gingerbread tethering wifi-hotspot usb-tethering dns	I am using a Sony Xperia Go mobile device with Android Gingerbread (2.3.7).Whenever I try to use Tethering (USB/Mobile Wifi Tethering), I could not immediately access website using my laptop. However, I know that there is an Internet connection because I can access websites using their IP address in my Google Chrome in my laptop. I tried nslookup in command prompt several times, trying to query Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) and 192.168.43.1 (my phone). I always get the error DNS request timed out. However, after several restarts, turning on/off Data and mobile hotspot, it would suddenly work and all the DNS requests through command line would get responses. But there is no definite number of restarts. Just today, it took me about 30-45 minutes doing this routine of restart-turn off hotspot-turn on-turn off mobile data-turn on. Every time I do this, I can use my mobile phone to access the Internet. So, that is not the problem. The mobile phone can connect to the Internet. I also use AirDroid. AirDroid is also working normally and I could access it in my browser. So there really is an established connection between the phone and the laptop. It's just DNS requests are not pushing through. I have tried this for both mobile hotspot/USB tethering. My mobile provider allows tethering and I have a mobile data plan. Can you help me determine what is causing the DNS problem? This happens almost every day.

1	Google Services battery usage	cyanogenmod samsung-galaxy-s-3 battery battery-life 4.2-jelly-bean	I recently updated to the 10.1 M snapshot of CyanogenMod for my Sprint Galaxy S3 (d2spr). Ever since I did the update, I have been seeing crazy high battery usage from Google Services. I have tried just about everything I can think of to shut it off, but nothing seems to be working. I'm connected to Wi-Fi most of the day, so I don't think 3G has anything to do with it. Attempted Troubleshooting: Turn off Google Account Sync (per this question ) Turn off Google Now Turn off Location reporting If possible, I'd like to fix this without using Juice Defender or any other battery management apps, but if that's what it takes, so be it. So how can I get Google Services to stop sucking the life out of my phone? 
1	Is it possible to mount .iso files (virtual optical drive) on Android?	mount	First of all, I am not sure if my question should be here as I couldn't find a place to shoot it. So please direct me to the right site, if I am barking at the wrong tree.. Question : In our normal PCs/laptops we have the ability to install 3rd party softwares to create a virtual CD/DVD drive and mount .iso files to it. For the sake of mobility, (as I am on the go 90% of the time) I want to buy a tablet. So I am wondering if I could do the same in either Asus or Samsung tablet 8.0? If above tablets can't perform this function, can someone point out why and which tablets would do it?

1	Is there a way to block access to or wipe my Google data for a lost/stolen phone	security google-account lost-phone remote-wipe	If my phone was ever lost or stolen, my only real concern is data and apps associated with my Google account, such as my Gmail, the ability to purchase apps from the Market, and maybe Picasa albums. Is there a way to block access to these Google associated programs if I change my password or do something else with my account? I would also be interested in any solution that remotely wipes my Google data. I know remote wiping questions have been asked before, but I feel that my question is a little more broad, in the sense of overall protection of data in which wiping is a possible answer. FYI, I'm running a Gingerbread-based ROM on my Samsung Galaxy S (AT&amp;T Captivate).

The signal is very weak. It's so weak that talking on the phone has been a hassle because people can't really hear me and I can't hear them. I found out how to switch from LTE to WCDMA, which makes the signal a little better, but then i miss out on the benefits of LTE.

I have to manually change from Priority Inbox to Normal Inbox (or vice versa) in order for the new emails to show up in my list. Is this happening for anyone else? Is there a fix for it? 
1	Second partition can't be mounted (link2sd)	cyanogenmod samsung-galaxy-ace external-sd link2sd	I'm trying to partition my external SD card (32GB SDHC), so I can link application to the second partition with link2sd. Now the problem is that, no matter what filesystem I use, link2sd can't create the mount script/fails to mount. I tried FAT32, FAT16, ext2, ext3 and ext4. Same result everytime, I tried formatting it with MiniTool Partition Wizard and ClockworkMod Recovery.

1	Music players that can import M3U playlists?	cyanogenmod bluetooth music media-player import	OK, so it seems that (unbelievably) Winamp for Android is so extremely stupidly designed that it can't import M3U playlists. So, I want a player that can import M3U playlists. I'm running CyanogenMod 7. I have copied some MP3s I want in a playlist to a directory on the sdcard, and used the "My Playlist Maker" app to make an M3U file that references the audio files inside that directory. Does anyone have some ideas for good music or media players that can import this M3U playlist? An additional requirement is that the player be able to set itself as the default player to be used with Bluetooth - Winamp, for example, has the "Control headset" (use Winamp to control the headset) checkbox setting.

This setup would also be cost effective, if the school uses any pay apps, as the app is linked to the account, not the devices. Does anybody have any experience or knowledge beyond, "I have 5 devices in my family all synced and it works."?

So before I wipe everything and spend hours setting up my phone from scratch, is there a way to manually change back to Dalvik from the recovery menu?

But I didn't see any way to automatically change profiles according to, for example, presence of a given WIFI network. So, my question is: what are those profiles for? Should I manually switch profile from work to home when I come back home? This make no sense! I searched but didn't find anything relevant, maybe because "profile" is a very generic noun.

I'm developing on Windows 7, have the Helios version of Eclipse, and have kept my SDK up to date. I have previously been developing on a Samsung Galaxy S2 fine - but now the SDK is having trouble detecting the Nexus 5. I have developer options, usb debugging, and third party apk's all enabled on the phone. When connecting the phone it appears as an eject-able USB device, appears as "Nexus 5" under Unspecified in devices and printers, and appears as "Android Composite ADB Interface" under "SAMSUNG Android Phone" in device manager. I have tried uninstalling the usb drivers I was using with the galaxy (including kies - its additional software) and then reinstalling drivers through the SDK manager, I have tried modifying the drivers as suggested here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19838016/what-usb-driver-should-we-use-for-the-nexus-5 and I have tried to install the generic driver here: http://adbdriver.com/downloads/ (but this failed as it could not find the nexus 5 as a connected android device). I've also tried simple things such as restarting eclipse, the phone, and my machine, and trying different USB ports. None of this has helped, I am unable to browse the nexus 5 as removable storage and when running projects in eclipse it does not appear as a running android device. Any help would be much appreciated.

1	How do I install cyanogenmod on a Galaxy Tab 3 (7.0)?	cyanogenmod samsung-galaxy-tab-3-7	For Christmas I got a Galaxy Tab 3 (7in, SM-T110) for the wee ones to play with. I want to secure it as much as possible so they cannot accidentally buy stuff or get tracked or whatever. So I thought I'd install Cyanogenmod. However, the device is not officially supported. From what I understand, I can still install Cyanogenmod on the device, it's just a bit more complicated. Obviously, it is possible, because there's "tutorials" out there about how to do it by people who have successfully done so. Never having done any of this, though. I got lost pretty soon among instructions on rooting, using ODIN, CWM, TWRP, ROM managers, and whatnot. Sigh. So what do I need to do in order to install Cyanogenmod? I suppose I need to root the device? Do I need a ROM manager? Or is it advisable? What do I need ODIN for? Do I need ODIN? What I need is 1) a thorough explanation what all of these buzzwords mean and what they are good for, and 2) a step-by-step for dummies for how to put them together. Note: I have seen this answer (which assumes the device to be supported) and this answer (which assumes too much knowledge).

I found some app out on the market for 6$ or so, but it doesn't look like it would be worth its price. It is called Permissions Denied . Any other way to block some permissions for some apps? Thanks. 
1	Is there an XMPP (Jabber) client for Android that supports video calling?	video-calling chat xmpp	I have searched quite a bit but still javen't manged to find a general Jabber client that supports video calling. There are a few that support sending video files though. 
1	Can I replace the OS of a Samsung Galaxy S?	samsung-galaxy-s launcher samsung-touchwiz	I was attracted by the hardware specifications of the Samsung Galaxy S. However, I don't like the default TouchWiz skin developed by Samsung. I'd prefer to use the native Android UI, as in the Nexus S and similar devices. Is it possible for me to perform "self installation" of the stock Android OS, after I bought the Samsung Galaxy S? If yes, how? Will I void the warranty of my phone by doing this? 
1	Fix permission option removed from CWM recovery 6.0.3.6	clockworkmod-recovery recovery-mode	I updated to latest ClockWorkMode recovery in my Galaxy S 3(AT&amp;T,d2att) . New version is 6.0.3.6. And noticed that Fix Permission option is removed from it. I used that option when flasing ROMs. I can't find why they did so. Will it affects flashing new ROMs? Is it not necessary?Anyone knows reason behind that update? 
1	Phone memory full and it shouldn't be	internal-storage insufficient-memory motorola-defy	I have a weird problem with my android phone: for some reason, I'm getting a 'Low phone memory' error message, and before getting the message the phone was slow and unresponsive. I have 2 GB internal storage; in the app manager, it says 1.2Gb used, 27Mb free. Where did the rest of the space go? I noticed this slowdown after installing an app (QR droid) from that Play Market (or whatever name it has now). When I first saw the error message, I had like 100 mb free in the app manager, and each time I reopened it the space was decreasing. The phone is a Motorola Defy, rooted and using Miui, android version is Gingerbread. So how can I fix this issue? 
1	Error: An application has been forced to stop for an unauthorized attempt to access system in your device.	samsung-galaxy-note-3 force-stop	I am getting the following error message every now and then. As far as I notice, it only happens if my phone has internet connection mostly on Wifi. an application has been forced to stop for an unauthorized attempt to access system in your device. it may be safe to delete an application obtained from an unauthorized route. Check now? When i click Check Now it just shows me list of all apps but don't tell me which is having problem. It is Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and it is not rooted or i don't remember i installed any application which is not from Play store. I googled and researched and found other people is getting same problem but i don't see any way to solve it. Anyone here knows how to fix it? 
1	how to root Galaxy SL GT i9003 for DDLF2	2.3-gingerbread rooting samsung-galaxy-sl	I am running official Samsung ROM build version 2.6.3 DDLF2. I wish to root it for reverse tethering and few other utilities. Need a trusted link for rooting tutorial or a rooting package for the same. 
1	Mount a folder from external sd as /data	external-sd mount micromax-a110	How do I mount /mnt/sdcard/data as /data . Right now the /data has its own partition but it's too small (~500mb) and I would much rather give it more space than move apps and other things to my SD card. My device is Micromax Canvas 2 A110. It has a ~2GB internal sd card mounted at /mnt/sdcard2 and an external one at /mnt/sdcard and /sdcard (I'm on some custom rom that switches internal and external default mount points like that) I don't know what filesystem those are in. 
1	Can I make a full backup of my phone with Odin and without root?	samsung-galaxy-s backup odin heimdall	As a follow up to this question , is it possible to use Odin (or Heimdall) to save a complete image of my phone without root? Odin already allows me to completely overwrite pretty much everything on my phone without root. Can Odin be used to read the entire contents of the phone over USB without root? Ideally, I'd expect the output of such a read to be something I can write in the future with Odin. While this question is somewhat general, I'm guessing that by asking about Odin and Heimdall I'm limiting it to Samsung phones (though I may be wrong). 
1	Tinder app won't work without Google Play services	applications google-play-store	I was trying to use the latest version of Tinder 3.3.1 but each time I get the following message: Get Google Play services This app won't work without Google Play services, which are missing from your phone. Since this is not covered by their FAQ and their support service ignored my inquiry, what is the reason for this happening? Why would Tinder need an active Gmail account on the phone? I'm asking since I use my Android device without a Google account, hence I'm not sure whether to expect Tinder to work correctly or not. In other words, what Tinder functionality could possibly break? EDIT I also noticed an additional notification from Tinder: Failed to Enable Push Notifications. Your Google account credentials are invalid. Could this explain why I am not getting any matches? 
1	Galaxy S3 high RAM consumption even on idle	samsung-galaxy-s-3 ram	I have a Galaxy S3 International Version, without any modification whatsoever-- no rooting, no nothing. It is as good as a stock phone with a few Play Store apps. However, of late, I have begun experiencing problems I do not have background processes (of my own) running and even then all I have left free in the RAM is usually only 300MB of the 800MB that is there. Task killers cannot free more than that. I experience lag when opening settings. What I mean is this: Say I click on the Battery option under Settings. There is a visible lag between the time I press the option and when the battery information is actually displayed on the screen. Android Version: 4.1.2 Build Number: JZO54K.I9300XXEMF6

1	"Cannot download, not enough space" when "Phone Storage" clearly lists enough space	2.1-eclair internal-storage storage pandigital-novel	I just installed Android 2.1 on my Pandigital Novel. Anytime I try to download an app (via WiFi), I get this error: Unable to download. Not enough space on phone. However, the phone lists the free space as being 125.57Mb, about 25 times the size of the file I wanted to install. I took the APKs I was trying to download and put them on my SD card. I was able to install them to the device from there proving it does indeed have space. What should I do? 
1	What does "obtaining IP address" mean?	wi-fi	When I try to connect to a free WiFi, my Xperia Android smartphone displays: obtaining ip address Why does it happen? Which IP address is that? Is it static or dynamic? Does this IP address identify my smartphone? Or does it identify the WiFi router and is its IP address common for different smartphones/laptops? 
1	Disabling MTP/PTP/all USB stuff except charging	usb cyanogenmod	Is there a way to disable all USB functionality except for charging? I don't really use MTP or PTP and would like to disable it if possible. 
1	Jar of Beans Android Emulator	android-emulator	Where is the link to the exe file? I find text "jar of beans.exe" and beneath it, a note saying wait for the emulator to load and enjoy, or a statement of similar meaning. The text "jar of beans.exe" is, however, not a hyperlink! I need the link. 
1	Galaxy Note 2 shows no sim card after radio flash	sim-card radio-firmware samsung-galaxy-note-2	I have the SGH-T889 (T-Mobile USA version of the Note 2). When I got my Galaxy Note 2, I loved the device, but disliked the software. So, I decided to flash CyanogenMod 10 build from the N7100 forums. Although many things worked, the radio did not work. So, I decided (in my infinite wisdom), to dd the radio from the Stock SGH-T889 T-Mobile rom to the /dev/block/mmcblk0p10 partition ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2039081 ). This did not work, so I installed the stock SGH-T889 rom just to get it back to working order. However, my sim card was no longer being detected. I have tried flashing other roms to try and get the radio back, but alas all say that there is no sim card. I realize I have probably permanently messed up my phone. Does anyone have any ideas or things to try to get it back to working order? I am out of things to try. UPDATE: I have tried everything you guys have posted, and ended up sending it back to Samsung and get them to fix it under the warranty. I believe they replaced the whole motherboard, so I will never know exactly what the problem was. If you decide to send yours back, make sure to reset the binary counter that you see in download mode. There are guides around the Internet for this. Thanks for all of the help. 
1	Can't add hotmail.com address into Gmail 5.0	gmail 5.0-lollipop accounts	I tried under KitKat and Lollipop on my Nexus 4 but I can't add my old account. I also tried both manual and automatic setup, but same result: credentials are incorrect. Any solutions about this? Should I have entered different parameters during the manual setup? EDIT: POP3 with default parameters: server hotmail.com, port 110, security STARTTLS IMAP with default parameters: server hotmail.com, port 143, security STARTTLS Exchange, which doesn't give the possibility to change any parameters 
1	Is there a valid Android alternative to iTunes U?	itunes	iTunes U makes the difference (at least, to me) when it comes to choosing a tablet for study purposes. Does it exist a valid Android alternative to Apple's iTunes U? For those who don't know iTunes U, it is a service that allows students and teachers to manage, browse and view media (such as videos and pdf files) related to education. 
1	Network problems with Samsung Galaxy Young (S6312)	calls connection-issues data-connection mobile-network samsung-galaxy-y	I'm having a network problem with my Samsung Galaxy Young (S6312) device. Sometimes while trying to make a call, even though the signal indicator shows 2 or 3 bars, the device displays a message like "Not registered on network" and the call doesn't get through. Also, sometimes while my mobile data is turned on it doesn't connect to the internet. I have set the mobile network to the GSM/WCDMA(AUTO) mode. Is there any solution for this? 
1	Is there a way to replace the 4.4.2-style emoji graphics with the Google Hangouts versions?	emoticons	I don't use emoji very often, but I did think the Google Hangouts-style emoticons were rather adorable. Following the 4.4.2 update, the graphics set used for emoji have been enabled in the stock keyboard, but in these rather unattractive cliche-looking versions which have also overridden the ones available in Hangouts. Is there any way I can get a Google Hangouts-style icon pack or something? All of the Google Play searches I've attempted returned mostly emoji keyboards which are NOT what I am looking for. 
1	changing the "hi galaxy" phrase. is it even possible?	lock-screens samsung-galaxy-note s-voice	Every once in a while, my note 3 wakes up on its own thinking somebody said "Hi Galaxy" and gets itself into the listening mode to start capturing what it hears from that moment on, then submits to Google for a search! Boy! I had a few situations and eventually I had to turn off that awesome feature. Is there a way to change this "hi galaxy" phrase to something less likely to be confused? Can I personalize it? Something like "ok Samsung, wake up now!" or "ok note 3, wake up now" etc...the longer the phrase, the less likelyhood for an unintentional match, I assume. Also, being able to personalize this phrase will prevent other people's getting your way... Imagine, the guy in the bus says "Hi galaxy" to his phone and all the galaxy devices in the bus within reach wakes up. LOL! 
1	Can you get a list of the RUNNING applications on Android for the purpose of activating them?	applications samsung-galaxy-s 2.1-eclair	On my Samsung Galaxy S Android phone: if I start a couple of apps, I can get an overview of them in the 'Active applications' icon on my first screen. Clicking this icon, shows me all active applications but allows me only to end them. I find no way to activate them. Pressing the center touchpath at the bottom displays the last 6 clicked icons - which may or may not be the ones running. F.i. if I start 6 applications, I see these 6 icons, if I start a 7th one I see the last 6 started. I wont see the first icon again . So how can I activate this first one, other than knowing it is running, and tapping it's icon again ? Please don't start telling me why I should start 6 or more applications. That's not the point, here , of course :) ANSWER: You can't - at least not by using the system as it is installed. A well, no big deal, really. Just wanted to see if I was missing something here. Coming from a Windows background ( and aren't we all because otherwise we should be holding an iPhone now ), this did not seem to illogical. Thanks for all answers. 
1	How can I minimize Applications in Android?	applications	In Android, is it possible to Minimize applications and continue using them again from the same point? When I press the middle button, the application closes, I see the application as "Running" in the Task Manager but when I open the application again, it does not resumes from the same point. I have tried this for various applications. I have a Samsung Galaxy Y. 
1	Galaxy S4 restarting and freezing after root	root-access reboot system-freeze samsung-touchwiz	I recently made the mistake of rooting my Galaxy S4, accompanied by a few more customizations. Problems that occur: TouchWiz freezes. One way to unfreeze is to hold down the Home button to see recently opened apps and then go back, so that Touchwiz wakes up. The other way is to pull down the Notification bar and click Settings or anything else from there that'll send me to a different app so I can avoid it. If I don't do any of these within 5 seconds the freezing occurs, the device restarts. The device also restarts when the CPU is suddenly expected to work hard. For instance, within the first minute of a call, or when the screen is locked/unlocked, a couple seconds after opening a music file. This happens 3-5 times a day, depending on usage. The restart is not always preceded by a freeze, but often there's a freeze before the restart. Recent changes that may be causing such behaviour: Rooting using AutoRoot by Chainfire. Giving CPU Master root permissions after SuperSU is installed. Installing busybox. Patching modded Google Play Store (involves patching Core.jar package) What I did so far: Uninstall CPU Master. Delete cache and data of Touchwiz Remove busybox Remove all custom patches from core.jar Install the original Google Play Store and update to latest version I don't think Touchwiz is causing the crashes because somethimes the phone restarts while an app is in use. Thanks in advance. EDIT: I removed the original Samsung ROM altogether and switched to Cyanogenmod. Thus I may not be able to upvote/tick the replies from then on. 
1	How can I root the Galaxy Tab 10.1?	rooting samsung-galaxy-tab-10	How can I root the Samsung GT-P7510? I've tried z4root and many others, but they all seem to support Android 3.1 and not 3.2. I gather 3.2 is specifically designed to eliminate the exploit that z4root and others depend on.

It switches back to the old buggy and lame Dalvik. XDA says, that ART provides a Bootloop in addition to xposes. Is a workaround to use both, or do I have to live with either one? 
1	Use existing contact for "Me" in Ice Cream Sandwich	contacts 4.0-ice-cream-sandwich	My Nexus S has just been updated to Ice Cream Sandwich, and I notice that in contacts there is a new space for "me". Is there a way to assign the existing ordinary contact for me (a contact with my name and details that I sometimes use for sharing with people, and sync with Picasa Photos etc.) to this slot? It seems related to this question , but that is about the similar HTC specific feature found on some phones.

1	What Tasker tasks require root access?	tasker root-access	I'm thinking of installing Tasker on my phone, but I don't want to root it. Is it worth my while? What Tasker tasks require root access? What can it do without root access? Edit: Here are some examples: I would like to turn on the GPS whenever I start certain apps (various driving directions apps, for instance), and turn it off when I exit them. I understand that apps can't turn on the GPS (otherwise the apps in question would do it themselves instead of directing me to the settings). Tasker claims to be able to do that. Does it need root for that? I remember seeing somewhere (lifehacker maybe?) that Tasker can disable the lock screen based on location, such as when I get home, and turn it off when I leave. Can it do that? Does it need root access for that? 
1	adb "Permission denied" to run a "./configure" file	adb sd-card shell file-permissions bash	I need to run a configure file into my android phone so I think the best way to do this is to use the adb shell command. I'm running an Android emulator onto a Windows-7 platform, and there I'm running the adb shell command into a DOS window. Using the cd command I'm changing to the directory where my configure file is, and then I'm executing the following command: ./configure . I'm getting the following error : ./configure: permission denied So I try to run adb in root mode with adb root -- but apparently my adb is already in root mode (Moreover I have the "#" character before each line of my adb shell). I have also tried to use chmod but I don't see any difference before and after executing this command ( ls -la ), so maybe the problem is here (How can I run the chmod command?). Maybe someone here can help me with my issue, and if you have also an explanation about why I don't have the permission to run my configure file it will be great. Thanks. PS: My goal here is to use the net-snmp package on an Android platform by compiling the sources of this project directly onto the platform.

1	Streaming Amazon Instant Video in HD	streaming amazon-video	Is it possible to watch HD Amazon Instant Video (eg, Amazon Prime) on non-Kindle Android devices? (Galaxy Nexus with MHL adapter) AFAIK, Amazon does not support HD streaming in the browser; this would require a native app. Google Play does support this, but I haven't been able to find anything about Amazon. (other than Flash streaming, which I don't think will do HD) 
1	Galaxy s2 will not boot, wrong bootloader	samsung-galaxy-s-2 bootloader odin	My Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I1900 won't boot. I tried to update to ICS with Kies which crashed, wherefore I unplugged the USB to start over. Now my phone had no OS, and wouldn't respond to Kies anymore. By mistake I flashed the downloaded original firmware into the bootloader section in Odin. Now it just shows a screen that says Samsung Galaxy SII GT-I9100 Next I tried to recover with Odin. I flashed another firmware, and the old bootloader and attached a PIT file which worked for me earlier. I want to now how I can make it work again. I have been looking for days for the following files: Original .PIT file Original Firmware Original Bootloader What should I do? I am using Odin v1.85.

1	How to record my calls on Nexus 4 with Android 4.4.2?	nexus-4 voice-recording	I've got a Nexus 4 with Android 4.4.2 and want to record my voice calls. My first idea was to simply use a recording app, so I've tried a whole bunch of call recording apps, but none of them work. They only record my voice, not the other side. Or they require the speaker / handsfree mode in order to record the other person (and then still sounds like crap). After some reading it seems not all phones/models support full 2-way voice recording. However I did read some claims about people pulling ot off on Nexus 4 (although it's not clear to me if this necessarily involves rooting and/or custom roms, which I'd rather avoid). Is there ANY way (preferably without rooting) to do proper 2-way phone call recording on a Nexus 4 running Android 4.4.2? 
1	Cannot install unsigned APK file on my phone	installation apk	I developed an app in Eclipse, and emailed to me the .apk file. It correctly downloads to my phone, then I go in Downloads and tap it. I choose "Install" and I'm getting App not installed message. What's the problem? I have a Nexus 4 phone, and "Unknown sources" option is selected. I can successfully install the app through Eclipse.

1	Wi-Fi connection dropping	wi-fi samsung-galaxy-nexus 4.1-jelly-bean	Lately I've been having trouble keeping a connection to Wi-Fi, first at home and now at work. What happens is that after a while I'll notice that my phone is using 3G. If I go into my Wi-Fi settings, I'll see a strong signal from my router. When I try to connect manually, I often get the message, "Failed to connect to network" with no further details. (There's a special place in hell for those who write error messages that give no indication of the nature of the problem.) Other times I can connect, but the signal is reported as weak and drops quickly. My computers can connect with no problems and report strong wireless signals. My roommates have no similar problems. I have a Galaxy Nexus running Jelly Bean. My roommates have a Galaxy Note and a Galaxy S2, respectively, both on ICS. What's wrong with my phone? Additional details My phone is rooted but running the stock ROM. My phone is the international GSM version. I first noticed this problem while using Tasker to implement a Bluetooth wireless leash . I've stopped using the leash--and Bluetooth entirely--but the problem persists. I'm still using Tasker for other things. In trying to track down this issue, I disabled "Avoid poor connections" but that change had no effect. I'm willing to consider flashing stuff to my phone as a last resort, but I strongly prefer alternative solutions. I didn't have problems initially, so I doubt the radio is to blame. Furthermore, I will down vote any answer that provides an incompatible ROM/radio, etc. or that provides it from a non-reputable source. 
1	How do I enter the Safe Mode on a HTC Desire?	htc-desire safe-mode	This is for those of you who need to enter what is known as "safe mode" on HTC Desire. There may be several reasons why one needs to enter this mode. It is usually because the phone is not working properly. One such reason can be that you have flashed your phone with a custom ROM and you are stuck in what is known as a "boot loop". If you manage to boot into safe mode you may be able to backup your data to a safe place before you attempt to rescue the phone by data destructive methods such a re-flash. 
1	Is there a way to adjust the size of the text when reading PDF files?	pdf ebook-reader reading	When I use Aldiko to a book in epub format on a mobile device with a small screen, I can read it without problems. The text is adjustable to the size, the application has no issues. The opposite is true when I'm reading pdf file. It's always a fight. The text is small and unadjustable and the application freezes. Is there a way to adjust the size of the text in my PDF files so that they are more easily readable? I don't intend to read scanned pdfs (this would be even bigger fight). I would like to be able to adjust text size, do scaling and not have the application freeze. I'm open to trying other readers if Aldiko cannot handle this. EDIT: The title was changed, but note that it's not only the change in the size of text. The text should be flexible to various sizes of devices. This is called floating text (or layout) in HTML terminology. A lot of PDF readers can change the text size without the text fitting the device screen.

After the ICS 4.0.3 update for Nexus S, there is no option for "3G only". Did Google lock down this option or is there a way to force "3G only"?

Ideally, I'd like to somehow cause that G1 to emit a wifi access point, so that whenever the G1 and the Gentouch are in close proximity, the Gentouch can piggyback off the G1's internet connection and reach the internet itself. Assuming I am willing/able to root both devices if necessary, how would I accomplish such a task? 
1	adb shell mount command: documentation?	adb mount documentation	I'm creating a guide for noobs on editing the SystemUI.apk on the US Galaxy S3. But, before I post the guide, I want to make sure I know my stuff! I'm looking to learn about ADB (and ADB shell) and its various commands. I've noticed that some users mount their system read-write like so: mount -o remount,rw /system But, others mount like so: mount -o remount,rw -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock4 /system I have a little bit of knowledge behind this (-o signifies options, yaffs2 signifies the file system, /dev/block/mtdblock4 signifies mount point, and /system is the actual directory), but why do people have different commands? Is it unsafe to miss some of the arguments? Why do some people include the mount point? The file system? Some separate multiple options using commas, others use spaces: does that matter? Instead of asking 50 questions like those, does anyone know where to find the documentation/reference/explanation of the mount command, and describing its options? If you are feeling extra great, any documentation/reference/explanation regarding ADB and busybox-for-android available? (Besides these: http://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html and http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html , which are a little lacking.) Someone knows these things, but my Google-fu is took weak... :( I would sincerely appreciate your guidance, any at all! :) 
1	How to install Cyanogen without losing data	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich cyanogenmod 4.1-jelly-bean updates samsung-galaxy-s-3	I've been using ICS on my Samsung Galaxy S3 for a while now, but I can't update to Jelly Bean for multiple reasons.

1	How can I download the backups ClockworkMod creates to my PC?	backup	I do not see them in the /clockworkmod folder when I connect my device to my PC. I tried using adb pull but adb does not show any devices when the device is in recovery mode (only if it's booted). Version is 4.2.1; ROM Cyanogen. Device is MAKO, and my PC is running Windows 7. The drivers for the device have already been added/installed from the android-sdk extras folder. The folders I see when I connect the device to win7 are different than those I see when I browse on the device itself. This issue might pertain to the way 4.2.1/4.2.2 creates folders (something about multi-user). 
1	Why does my Samsung GT-i9000 not detect USB connectivity (not a driver problem)?	samsung-galaxy-s usb	I have made several searches across many boards but failed at finding a solution for my problem yet, even though it's been reported by some. My phone was working fine for about a month, I was using the mass-storage technique without a problem until it stopped working one day. Now, when I plug in my phone by usb to any computer, the connection screen will not come up, the battery charging icon sometimes fails to appear as well and I can hear the computer detecting a new device but it will not recognize it. I did a hard reset on the phone, which ended up in 2.1 instead of the 2.2 i had, and the problem persists. I have tried everything, from usb debugging mode to uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, even tried with my friend's cable and it does the same thing...I am very frustrated! Anybody got a fix for me? 
1	How can I stop my phone from thinking it's connected to a computer?	usb notifications	I plugged my phone into my TV's USB port hoping to play video from my phone on the TV. This was not successful. It's been about 4 days since I disconnected from the TV and it still thinks it's connected. I have turned the phone off and on, it may go away for a little while but keeps coming back. The top left status bar will have 2 arrows spinning in a cirle and when I drag downwards to see my notifications I see this: MTP service status: Connected to computer Any ideas? My phone is an HTC Incredible 2 running Android 2.3.3.

1	Clear Google Play Failed Download Space	google-play-store internal-storage nexus-7	I recently tried installing an app that was around 1.8GB to my Nexus 7 (8GB). it's a device with unfortunately small internal storage, so I had about 2GB free before attempting the install. I come back later, the download has failed due to not enough storage space. no big surprise there. but now, my device only has 350MB free! strangely enough, the graph in storage settings appears as if it had that full 2GB or so free, but lists only 350MB. how can I get my free storage space back from the failed download? my device is rooted, no root file browser or terminal, but I do have the Android SDK and tools. another thing to note: my device is constantly complaining about its free space in the form of a notification. also, every app download from Google Play (even a tiny 2MB app) fails due to not enough storage space. for some reason, that always happens when my device goes under 500MB free. I don't understand it, but, it's 'normal'. 
1	Can you install a generic ROM on any device?	rom-flashing custom-roms	I am relatively new to rooting and stuff. I have just rooted my android tablet. It's a Chinese tablet, not much about it is available on the internet. Can I install ROM for another device on my tablet? I saw many videos on YouTube showing "How to install any ROM on any Android device". Does 'any' here mean that I can install, let's say, a Nexus ROM on my tablet? Is there some generic ROM which can be installed on all androids? If so, can I install this generic ROM and then upgrade to a ROM of another device? If no, is there a way to do so? (If not, then how do manufacturers put their ROM for the first time?) 
1	Android on Samsung Galaxy Duos is too slow	performance samsung-galaxy-s-duos	I've bought a Samsung Galaxy Duos GT-S7562 with Android 4.0.4 3 months ago. The phone is so slow and getting slower by the ay, it has become almost useless. For instance, to look up and call a contact can take more than a minute. Some apps simply won't start, nor work and prefer crashing. I can literally count to 3 between the moment I click to take a picture and the moment the camera will actually take the picture. I haven't found a solution to this on Internet so far. The only thing I can think of is tossing the phone on a wall, but somehow I think that won't help. How can I make my phone be worth the 200$ I paid for again?

1	Move app to SD card	samsung-galaxy-s-3 4.1-jelly-bean rooting app2sd	I'm currently confused on what mods to be used now. My unit by the way is Samsung Galaxy S3 I9300-International (rooted with Omega ROM 42.3 and Kernel SiyahKernel v1.9.1). The reason why I rooted my phone is to be able to move apps to SD card. My choices are here: DirectoryBind ExtSd2InternalSd I don't know which is the right one to use in terms of compatibility even on Android 4.2 JellyBean because I'm too scared of bricking my phone. The first choice was published in 2011 while the other one was 2012. I don't know which is more stable for my phone. Hope for your kind suggestion.

1	How can I find out what app is using my GPS from the background?	geolocation services	 Possible Duplicate: How to check which app uses GPS on Galaxy Nexus? I saw the location icon at the top while on the home screen of my Galaxy Nexus. There were only two running apps and I cleared both of them, but the location icon was still there. I've discovered that if I turn location off then on again, it will go away, but I'd like to find out which of my apps is using this so I can consider uninstalling it or changing a setting. Is there a way to do this? I presume maybe an app that detects this or some system thing? 
1	How to flash a custom recovery with heimdall (without touching the main system)?	samsung-galaxy-s rom-flashing recovery-mode heimdall	The first recommended step in the installation of CyanogenMod on Samsung Galaxy S is flashing a custom recovery like ClockworkMod or the one from Replicant with a command like: heimdall flash --kernel path/to/recovery.img Now I feel that the instructions might be misleading: I have done the first step wanting just to have a custom recovery mode, without proceeding to replacing the main OS on the device. It seems I have done that wrong, because the device now always boots into the recovery mode. What would be the correct heimdall command to just install a custom recovery system without touching the main system?

1	Why does my Android OS state that there's, "Not enough free space to install the program", when there's plenty of free space?	installation insufficient-memory	My hard drive on my smartphone has 100 MB free, and the app I'm trying to install is 2 MB. I just recently deleted apps totalling to about 88.3 MB, and the computed size has already been adjusted, and is displayed on the screen. However, I have to wait 10 or 15 minutes to install it. It's as if the updated, computed space is not registered in some way to the operating system immediately. It's Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread, no root, no unlocked; factory pre-set all the way(not for long though). So, basically, is that the problem? Why do I have to wait a while after uninstalling apps, and re-computing space availability to above par to install a new, extremely small app, to actually work? Is this all the OS's fault, or is something else at play here(e.g., hard drive or circuit-level operations reigning outside the control of just the OS software)? Because if the re-computed size is what it's going to be, at least let the end-user know that rather than give the impression that you have the available space, but it won't install anything. 
1	How can I remove trusted CAs on Android?	security certificates	From the current fallout around DigiNotar (in short, a Root Certificate Authority that has been hacked, fake HTTPS certificates issued, MITM attacks very likely), there are some parts concerning Android ( see yesterday's interim report in PDF ): fraudulent certificates for *.android.com has been generated (which would include market.android.com) there may be other such fraudulent certificates signed by this CA in the wild (currently nobody knows for sure, one way or the other) this could happen to another CA in the future (Comodo had a similar problem a few months ago) So, how do I remove a CA I no longer trust from my Android phone? (I have root and CM6 on my specific phone, if that's relevant) 
1	CWM: Almost any rom I try to install returns "(Status 0)" [HTC One GSM]	rom-flashing clockworkmod-recovery htc-one	CWM version: 6.0.4.3 touch I tried to update my CM 10.2 to 11, but I always run into this error when installing a zip from SD card: E:Error in /data/media/0/[filename].zip(Status 0)Installation aborted. This happens for every rom I try to install, except a Kitkat AOSP rom I tried. Even the 10.2 Rom I still had around on the card threw an error, but a different one. I can't remember what exactly, but it looked like it couldn't match my phone's type ( m7 ) to m7 or m7ul I think my phone somehow forgot that it is an m7 Anyone got an idea how I can install roms again? 
1	Is it possible to use my SD card as ROM and my internal ROM as an additional RAM?	2.3-gingerbread rom ram root-access	I've read somewhere that I can do some certain things to partition my SD Card specially to allot some part or all of it to trick the phone into thinking it's the "internal" ROM. For the life of me, I can't seem to locate that article anymore. I'm looking forward to rooting my phone and this has been on one of my to-do list once I get around to rooting. The next issue I want to bring up is that, once I've achieved the above procedures, I typically won't be using my phone's original internal ROM anymore and was thinking if it was possible to allot that unused internal ROM as additional RAM. So in essence, my phone's internals will only be used as RAM and the ROM will be the SD card's burden. That way, I can hopefully maximize my phone's usability. Can anyone shed some light on this?

I haven't used it for a couple of months, and when I fired it up today I'm seeing the same error every time I launch the Market app: No connection and a Retry button. It doesn't matter how many times I hit Retry, I just end up back in the same place. The phone definitely has a solid Wi-Fi connection though and all other online apps (browser, Twitter, etc.) are working well. I've tried force stopping the Market and restarting, clearing its data and uninstalling updates, all to no avail. What can be causing this error?

1	When will my device get the Android 4.4 update (KitKat)?	updates 4.4-kitkat	Android 4.4 (KitKat) was officially announced on October 31, 2013. (You can review the high level changes in KitKat at the official Android Developer's site or the announcement on the official Android blog .) Of course, not all devices will get this update right away and others won't get it at all. Each manufacturer and carrier often choose to add their custom modifications which tend to delay the official release. When will each device get Android 4.4, either officially or unofficially, if ever? See also: When will my device get the Android 4.3 update (Jelly Bean)? When will my device get the Android 5.0 update (Lollipop)?

The battery in my S5 will usually last me 2-4 days without charging, depending on use, but two or three days ago the battery started dying very quickly despite minimal use. The battery will no longer even last 24 hours without use. I checked my phone's battery usage, and com.android.systemui seems to be causing the excess battery drain. What's causing com.android.systemui to drain so much battery, and what can I do to fix it? Battery usage (click image for larger variant) 
1	Why are Dialer, Cell standby, and Phone idle killing my battery?	cyanogenmod battery-life htc-desire-z standby cellular-radio	HTC G2 with Cyanogenmod 7.2.0, T-Mobile. It used to last all day, I'd always plug the phone in before bed and it would rarely run out of energy before then. Lately it runs out mid-day. Today I disabled Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, etc, and it still emptied the battery in 5 hours, with Dialer, Cell standby, and Phone idle as the highest battery users. It may be due to upgrading from CM 7.1 to CM 7.2 ? I upgraded sometime after 2012-11-13 and noticed this around 2012-12-31. Worked fine for more than a year before that. Reception is 4 out of 4 bars, so it's not due to hunting for cell towers . Phone is noticeably warm when it happens, so it's due to something using energy, and the problem appeared suddenly, so it's not due to a failing battery. Update: Today it was bad for an hour or two and then became normal (normal is a few percent an hour). You can see the abrupt change in the image below. I don't know why. The battery usage list looks identical to yesterday, so if it's due to an app, it's not a visible app. I realized I could click the graph and see a more detailed one, and it shows "Awake" during the part where the battery is being eaten while the display is off: Is this a "wakelock"? I did change the GSM preferences to "Auto mode" instead of "WCDMA preferred", but that was last night and it was still eating the battery quickly this morning for a while.

1	How to put a ROM on read-only /sdcard, while adb shell not working (HTC One X)	adb custom-roms sd-card bootloader shell	I've been searching my _ off for two days now to find a solution for my problem, but I can't find one working for me. What I do have right now: NO working ROM (I believe because of a failed atempt to revert to a backup in CWM) Access to my bootloader (unlocked through HTCDev) Access to my recovery (Which is the latest CWM) Fastboot/adb working Phone boots upon the HTC logo screen NO ROM zipfile on the SD-Card (I accidentilly deleted that, I still hate myself for that) I've managed to push to ROM file into both /data and /system , which (of course) isn't usefull to flash from because they don't show up in CWM. What I've tried: Reverting to a Nandroid backup, I've 2 on the sdcard. Both don't pass the part where /system is being restored. adb shell to push files, or mount the SD card, does not work. First I had the error saying '--exec /system/bin/sh failure: file or dir not found (2)'. I managed to push the sh file into system, (and I believe into /system/bin ), and the error changed to '[...] No directory (20)' adb push &lt;ROM.zip&gt; /sdcard/&lt;ROM.zip&gt; ; doesn't work because /sdcard is read-only. In CWM I can't mount as USB storage, is says something about a file which can't be found. TWRP recovery doesn't work on my device, I can touch whatever I wan't, the only button responding is the power button, which causes a locked recovery, which I can't unlock. (You need to swipe for that, which my phone seems to ignore). I've read almost every topic on XDA and whatever Google could give me, but most solutions somewhere relied on the adb shell , or pushing into the /sdcard , or simply assume I still can mount as USB storage. :( Does anyone have any suggestions left on howto get a ROM into the <
1	Can USB charging (via mains adapter or from PC/Mac) of Android tablets be the main, primary method of charging? Or are there design issues?	usb tablet charging usb-connection-mode	Are there design issues with tablets being charged by USB not seen with Android phones? I saw this on another forum, what are your thoughts on this with regard to my question? http://forums.androidcentral.com/acer-iconia-a100/112270-charge-via-usb-port.html#post1696260 An important consideration in the design is the amount of current the usb connectors can handle. I figure the designers find that it is safer to design a separate charging and power connector because as the devices get larger they draw more current to operate and charge the battery. I think that is the reason they do that. Is there no 12 volt adapter for these devices? I don't own one yet, just leaning towards the acer 7 inch tablet. I would prefer charging via USB (via mains or PC) when considering a tablet so that I don't have to carry around a specific charger. Many Android phones use their micro USB port for charging - connecting the USB cable to a mains adapter or using the cable to connect to a full size USB port on a computer. I see that some major brand Android tablet manufacturers (Motorola, Asus) as well as some smaller less know brands either use a separate power input (non micro-USB) or a dock.

1	How can data on an unrooted phone be backed up?	backup	 What methods are available to back up data (both system and application) from a phone which is not rooted and is running stock Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread? It is my understanding that it is impossible to retrieve application data (not stored on the SD card) on an unrooted phone, except where the application itself offers export. Is this accurate? Of the system settings and built-in applications, which ones have export facilities I can take advantage of? Which ones notably have no export and have significant amounts of data which I might want to manually transcribe out? I am already using Missing Sync for Android which takes care of the contacts, calendar, photos, call log, and SMS messages. My phone is a Nexus One.

1	What can be saved before factory reset?	backup factory-reset	My phone has a GPS problem and service says the need to wipe it completely. They are probably just lazy and would rather do it the easy way. C'est la vie. The phone is SGS unrooted 2.3.4 - Touch Wiz. I don't want to root it. Now, what I am going to do is this: - Save contacts with Kies - Save files Is there anything else I can do or that I should know? For example, I believe that apps associated with the Google Account will be reinstalled after I re-enter my account into the newly formatted phone, correct?However, app data like savegames won't be ported, I have to search for them in the phone memory? Can I backup SMS? Can I back-up settings? Will imported contacts keep all fields like I have them now, i.e. work phone, home phone, work email, home email etc? I know it's a ton of questions, sorry about that.Thank you.

1	Is it possible to selectively limit background data usage?	data-connection background-data	I have a sufficient data-plan so I've never worried about this... tomorrow though, I'm travelling abroad. Due to this, I will have restricted 3g usage. Are there any apps or Android settings to prevent certain applications from syncing in the background while allowing others to work unrestricted? For example, if I only want to use WhatsApp or check emails, without "Android OS" or Facebook playing around online, would this be possible? If I could have this as a "roaming only" profile/mode would be an advantage. If I could also allow these applications to run as normal when WiFi is available, that would be a bonus! My device is not rooted and I would prefer not to root it to achieve this. Are there any apps or solutions to achieve this? 
1	History of files sent over Bluetooth?	bluetooth logging	Does Android keep a history of the files sent via Bluetooth? I didn't see anything like that in the user interface (there's a log of received files, but not sent ones), but maybe there's a hidden log file somewhere?I need to check past activity. Installing an app to start logging this now won't help me.

1	Lock Screen Pattern Too Small After Android 4.3 Update on Samsung Galaxy S3	samsung-galaxy-s-3 lock-screens 4.3-jelly-bean pattern-lock	A few days ago, my Samsung Galaxy S3 finally got the OTA update to Android 4.3 from Verizon. Before the update, when I was running Android 4.1.2, the pattern on my lock screen looked like the 1st image below. Not only was the pattern larger, but it also had a visible "shadow", providing an easy way to see how big each circle is before you begin highlighting. After the update to Android 4.3, the pattern on my lock screen now looks like the 2nd image below. The pattern has decreased in size by about 30%, and it is now harder to see where each circle is before you begin highlighting (as I have started to do in the image below). So my question is two-fold: 1) Does there exist a way to make the lock screen pattern larger on Android 4.3 so that it looks more like it previously in Android 4.1.2 without the use of a third-party app? I don't intend on using the space provided for widgets above the pattern, so a solution that causes this functionality to be removed in the process is acceptable. 2) If no native solution exists, is there a third-party app that I can download that will allow me to substitute the default home lock screen pattern for one that is larger? I am aware that there are app-specific lock screens with large patterns, but I am referring to the home lock screen only. Before Update (Android 4.1.2) After Update (Android 4.3): 
1	nlpwakelock and "Use wireless networks" option	battery-life location-services wakelock	Under "Location services" there is a "Use wireless networks" setting - whenever the setting is on, I get constant "nlpwakelocks" and the battery drains a lot faster. However, I see that this was supposidely fixed by Google: http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/05/29/download-latest-google-play-store-4-1-10/ (my version is 4.3.11) but I still get the wakelocks on my SGSIII. Is the device constantly requesting my location with this option on, or is my network connectivity changing and the wakelock is triggered each time (e.g. wifi networks and cell towers coming in and out of range)? It would be good to be able to use the option, as apps such as Google Now can know where I am but the battery drain means that I have to toggle each time and remember to turn it off.

1	How to sync calendar with android without google?	sync dropbox calendar	is there a way to sync an Ubuntu calendar application like Thunderbird Lightning or Evolution with an Android device without using google-calendar? At the moment I am syncing my Thunderbird-Lightning calendars on different computers via Dropbox, what is much more reliable than google-calendar. Another big advantage over google-calendar is, that I can access my appointments offline as well, since the calendar files are synced onto the harddrive of each computer by Dropbox. I'd like to access those calendars via my android device as well. The Dropbox-app for android does not support automatic syncing yet, so it seems like I have to use another service. Apart from that I guess I need to know an android app, that can access a calendar-file stored in ics-format. Thanks in advanceYSN

Thinking of cool &amp; stylish messaging experience? Try out another bestseller: ColorGlass Theme&nbsp; (Apply it through menu->theme) It's extremely annoying.

1	Why did my Galaxy Tab 7.7 suddenly stopped connecting to my Wifi router?	wi-fi connection-issues samsung-galaxy-tab-7.7	I have Galaxy Tab 7.7 tablet running Android 3.2. Recently, I'm having connection problems to my home Wifi router. The device keeps scanning for Wifi access points for long periods. My home Wifi router is shown with a "Not in range" message next to it in the Wifi settings screen. However, sometimes after long period of time, the device randomly connects to the Wifi router. It is worth mentioning that during the scanning mode the device does not detect any Wifi access point even thought where I live there are many Wifi access points (over 8 access points). What is the solution to my problem? 
1	Can I sync my Kindle books with my Android phone?	htc-desire email ebook-reader amazon-kindle ebooks	I have just bought a Kindle and the cool thing about it is you have an email address @kindle.com where you can send your books and it automatically converts it to a .azw and syncs it with your Kindle. I was under the impression it would also sync the books with all your devices, including the Kindle app on my Android phone (Isn't this the whispersync thing?). However, it doesn't seem to do this. Is there way to also sync all my books to my phone as well as my Kindle automatically?

I did call my operator, and they didn't had any report like this so far, and I did call Samsung service, and they didn't know about this issue, so I guess is on my side. If you have any idea what would the problem be let me know.

1	Is there a way to clear your Google Play App history? (Not the search history)	applications google-play-store	 Possible Duplicate: How to remove apps from &ldquo;all downloaded&rdquo; in Play Store I'm looking to see if there is a way to clear the actual history of installed apps in Google Play, as opposed to the history of searches (which one can do right from the app). It'd be nice to be able to wipe out the old apps that I tried months ago and uninstalled. The sorting of the "All" apps list is actually pretty good, in that such apps tend to be at the very bottom; but if I go on a tangent trying a dozen different similar apps until I decide on one, I'll have those in my list for a bit. And, sure... there are a few apps in that list I installed then removed that might generate a blush or two if someone else saw it. I wouldn't expect to be able to remove apps that I have installed on any of my devices (nor would I want to, anyway)... just apps that I installed previously but do not have any longer. 
1	How to select ALL text in web browser?	browser	On my Nexus One's built-in browser, I am able to copy web page text to the clipboard by: selecting Settings > More > Selecttext , then dragging my finger from top tobottom (of the screen), seeing pagecontent highlighted in pink, then the moment I release my finger,the pink highlight goes away and isreplaced by a friendly message:"Text copied to clipboard". I can then paste it to a clipboard "viewer" app (which is not really a clipboard viewer but rather a clipboard "paster"). The problem is that, no matter what I do, my finger doesn't seem to pick up the entire text on that page. There is always something missing: A few characters from the page start, or from the page end. Is there something similar to Ctrl+A on Windows?

So if you uninstall the app for any reason or switch phones your messages will be lost. Since messages are visible in my app I imagine there is a way to save them. So I wonder how. As a programmer, I know there must be a way to retrieve them, regardless of what tech support says. I can always take screenshots of individual conversations, if I wanted but that's not a viable way to save this data.

0	How do I find and change voices?	usb	Using a program called Osmand, my old Samsung Galaxy Y phone (Android 2.3.6) had a pleasant English voice in a folder called osmand\voices\en-tts . Having installed a newer version of Osmand on my Moto G phone (Android 4.4.4) this has changed to an annoying American voice. ES File Explorer shows the same folders, so I wanted to try replacing the en-tts folder with the old one. However, my Windows 8.1 File Explorer does not show any folders under osmand with the one exception of the tracks' folder. Can anyone explain this and show me a way to access the voices folder from my W8.1 PC?

This only happens some of the time, sometimes it pauses as it should. Also, this may be related. If I get in the car after using spotify on headphones, it will start playing on the bluetooth even if I had paused and closed the app long before. I'm not sure if it's related, but it's more strange bluetooth issues. My phone is a completely up to date Samsung Galaxy S5 with no alterations like being jailbroken or anything. Just a base model S5. My carrier is ATT.

0	How do I type numbers on a Galaxy Stratosphere II's physical keyboard?	keyboard samsung	When using the Galaxy Stratosphere II's physical keyboard, completions are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Each completion is numbered. Pressing a number key causes that completion to be selected. This makes it impossible to type multiple digit numbers without completing the number, hitting Backspace , adding a digit, completing again, hitting Backspace again, and so on. Is there a way to disable this completion? I have no use for it anyway. I looked under Language and Input settings but there does not seem to be an option for it. I disabled Auto-replace , Auto capitalization , and Auto-punctuate under Physical keyboard , but this did not fix the issue. EDIT discovered that completion can be disabled on a per-application basis. Still hopeful that there is actually a reasonable way to type numbers when using the completion feature, and that there is some way to disable completion on a global basis, since some apps may not offer this option. If there is no way to disable completion globally, is there a way to type numbers despite the completion?

Everything was okay until I installed Xposed framework. I got into a boot-loop. I fixed it by installing "FlexOS", another custom ROM I found on XDA. Now I installed "Pac-man ROM", and it boots after optimizing apps, but while I'm doing the initial setup, it restarts. But when I restore from my Nandroid backup, it doesn't restart, it keeps normal.

0	Being notified when GPS is not moving	gps	I'm using the app Endomondo, to track my cycle training. Almost every second time, I forget to stop the time taking. And the app does not give a warning or anything, so it can keep recording for even hours afterwards before I notice. It is possible to edit the recording, but only by exporting, editing locally, and importing to webapp again. I think it's "impressive" that Endomondo does not notify of not moving, nor allows easy editing, since I know many people make the same mistake again and again. They started talking about this back in 2012, but haven't gotten to it yet. A solution could be installing another app, that I can start at the same time as when starting the recording in Endomondo. And this other app should then notify me when I'm not moving, to remind me to stop recording in Endomondo. Does such an app exist?

0	What is the best way to copy a TV PC?	settings backup titanium-backup	I had two EKB328 TV PCs and just bought another from Amazon. The price went down! I use one for a big screen TV, one for a thin client for windows, and the new one will also be used as a thin client. I've kept the two I already have alike. If I install a game or utility on one, I do the same on the other. The devices come rooted. Each device uses FolderSync to copy the Titanium Backup folder to it's own place on the windows machine. To set up the second device, the first thing I did was install Titanium Backup and FolderSync, then go in reverse. Occasionally I use Titanium Backup to export an application from one to the other. I want the new EKB328 to be just like one of the others. What is the best way to do this? A lot of set up and configuration is required before a Titanium Backup restore is performed. Is it even worth worrying about a better way to make the device similar, since it may be easier just to go ahead and do the configurations manually? I will probably put both screens side by side.

0	Phone flashes a bright white and then reboots	audio samsung-galaxy-nexus reboot system-freeze	Recently, I have been having an issue with my Android phone. It is a Galaxy Nexus phone using Android version 4.2.2, build number JDQ39. Whenever the phone tries to play any sort of sound (for example a phone call), the phone remains silent and also it freezes. This even happens when the phone is set to silent or vibrate at times when sounds should be played, like in a game or a notification. After a while, the screen's colors will flash brightly and then turn black. Then the phone will reboot on its own. This happens sporadically: sometimes the phone will work fine, playing sounds without issue, yet sometimes the phone will just constantly freeze up and reboot. Now, I am somehow still able to use my phone at any time specifically when headphones are plugged in. The phone is always in one of four states: 1. phone works when headphones are plugged in.2-4. when headphones aren't plugged in it: 2. works fine 3. works but the sound is staticy at low volumes 4. freezes up on playing any sound even on vibrate or silent Is there any way I can fix this problem?

All my Exchange (run by me) contacts had disappeared, as well as the calendars on that account. Also, my Microsoft account had disconnected somehow, so those calendars were gone as well. I first re-added the Microsoft account, so I had access to those calendars again, which worked fine. Then I added the Exchange account again. This is done using the Boxer app which comes pre-installed on Cyanogen OS 12 devices (I'm using the OnePlus One). The first minute, everything runs fine and I get to check my mail. After that first minute, when it syncs everything again, the calendar syncs every split second and every split second, a new calendar appears for my Exchange account, in both Google's Calendar app and aCalendar. Every other aspect of the account (mail and contacts) are fine though. Is this problem Boxer or Android related, and how can I fix this? I do want to use the Exchange calendar.

0	Noise in Calls on LG L40 Dual	calls	I've just bought a LG L40 Dual cellphone, and I notice at first that I hear some noise on calls. Like that moment when a phone is about to ring and it's close to some speakers, you hear an interference. Well, I hear that while I'm in the call, at very low volume, but appreciable, because I have my ear next to the speaker. I must say there's no big interferences here, I'm at my house. This didn't happened in my other phones. Is this phone wrong from factory or some Android problem? Is it normal on Dual SIM phones? 
0	Outgoing calls starting after a long delay in Samsung Galaxy Y	2.3-gingerbread samsung samsung-galaxy-y	When I click the call button or slide in the contact list will not start the call. I can move back to the home/previous screen. However, the call will not started. For eg: If I repeatedly try to make a call five times, after a long delay the call will be initiated. But after I try to cut the call it again starts another call. It will happen 5 times since I hit call button for five times before. Sometimes the call is not started and I have to restart the phone for making a call. My phone is rooted but with the stock rom(Android ver. 2.3.6). 
0	Stolen phone: Is there any way to get Automatic Call Recorder recordings that were set to be stored in SD card?	applications data-recovery	I had extremely important calls recorded of ex-boyfriend threatening my life and admitting to the things he did that I'm taking him to court for. But my phone was stolen recently, and I had only set the app to save the recordings to my SD card. Is there a way to retrieve those recordings? Maybe they are saved somewhere I just don't know about? When I got my new phone I downloaded the same app and these recordings are saved to my Google drive, but old ones aren't there. 
0	App Filtering apps to protect from bad content	browser filter	Good afternoon. I was searching for an app that suits a friend of mine. He gave me an Android tablet and he wanted me to "filter" the tablet so he only can visit 2 or 3 pages, and use the rest of apps, excluding google play. I've searched a lot, with kid filters, kid browsers, firewalls... But none of them suited for him. Why? I tried Droidwall, but it didnt work to get to the webpages he wanted, the configuration of iptables wouldn't let me. I tried NoRoot Firewall... It did work but it has 2 problems: I can't deactivate the permanent notification in the status bar (I can't, I've tried to disable notifications), and when the phone reboots, it doesn't start after you press "run" I tried Kids Safe Browser but you have to pay and I don't know if it has more problems.. I haven't tried it! I'm a bit stuck now, so I'd appreciate all your comments Bye! 
0	I have a Nexus 5 and was using am mobile hotspot	wifi-hotspot	On my Nexus 5, I was using the default "mobile hotspot". I am recently moving and I have no WiFi to use for my Sony PlayStation 3. It was working fine for a week or two now; but just the other night it stopped. I tried turning my console, and my phone off and turning them back on. Nothing happened. It connects to the IP address but fails to connect to any internet connection. I have no idea what is going on, and I am severely flustered that this is a problem. Is there something I am missing? I have tried everything to try and lower my data, all the way to just trying to reset my phone. Yet, nothing is happening. I'm only able to use the hotspot until I get settled into a new place to live, because I will have WiFi. But is there some thing that can make my hotspot work again? Please help.

0	How do I silence "Galaxy Apps"?	notifications samsung-galaxy-s-4 ringtone	By "Galaxy Apps" I don't mean "apps installed on my Galaxy S4", I specifically mean the app called "Galaxy Apps". Apparently, the purpose of the app is to keep the pre-installed junk that cannot be removed Samsung's own apps up-to-date. Just like "Play Store", "Galaxy Apps" shows a notification in the notification tray when updates are available. That's a good thing. However, unlike "Play Store", "Galaxy Apps" makes a noise when doing so. The noise is the same as the default SMS notification tone. That's a bad thing (or, at least, an annoyance), because it makes me think that I got some important text message when, in fact, I didn't. To make a long story short: Can I somehow tell "Galaxy Apps" to: do tell me when updates are available (I don't want security issues on my mobile phone just because some junk that I don't use some pre-installed application is not up-to-date), but be silent while doing so?

0	My son's tablet has been stolen and I am trying to locate it..	tablet	I had installed the Android device locator on my son's tablet should it ever get lost or stolen and I had tried locating it my several first tries were a failure as it said that the device was unable to be located. But at those points I had three options "ring, lock and erase" so I chose to lock it but was unsure if it worked, so I repeated this step like 2 more times. Checking to see if the device has been located frequently, I had noticed at one point in time the device was turned on and located (was unable to find exact location because the session had expired, so I had to relog in) but then I noticed at this time my options were different saying "ring or enable lock and wipe" so I pressed enable lock and wipe and it said "request sent to lock and wipe admin features..Does anybody know what this means?

0	Android Auto-Shutdown	shutdown	I own a Samsung Galaxy S4 (Lollipop 5.0.1) and have recently had the problem if it automatically shutting down whilst in mid-use. I would try turning it on again only for it to quickly shut itself down after the Samsung logo appears on the screen.

0	Alternative for Storage permission	storage permissions	I noticed that almost all apps request the Storage permission, and this is quite OK since they need to store stuff to function properly. But it's a bit bugging me that they have access to all of my data. Mainly because most apps need storage for their own files, and have nothing to do with my pics, songs, etc. So ideally I would like to grant apps the permission to write any amount of data to the storage, but that it cannot read/modify any other data. Is there an alternative permission that grants access to write any file to the storage, but read and modify only files the app itself has created? 
0	Tablet and old Nexus don't appear in device manager	android-device-manager	I have three devices, a nexus 5 that I use daily and a Nexus 7 and 4. The last time I used Android Device Manager I could see all three. Now I looked but I can only see the N5. The other two (N7 and N5) don't show up. Tried both on the app on the N5 and in Chrome on the PC. I want to see when my N7 was last seen because it bricked a while back (probably within the warranty period) and I just sent it in for repairs (outside warranty period). If I have a screenshot I can prove it broke within the warranty. Does anyone here know how I can get the N7 to show up in Device Manager again? Or any other trick how I can prove when it last worked? Thanks GJ

The phone is in Airplane mode aside from Bluetooth being on. I have a Soundpeats Q2 Bluetooth headset to listen. The music is loaded on a 32G SD card. Here's my question/problem: about 75% of the time, at the start of a song and seemingly at random, I get a dropout in the music of about half a second sometime during the first 5-10 seconds of playback. This seems to be independent of how fully charged the phone or the headset is. It does not recur until the next song. Where would you suggest I look to start troubleshooting this?

0	Huge system data on my Blu quattro phone, #9009# does not work	internal-storage system	Most of my Blu quattro (not rooted) phone's storage is taken by system data. I checked it with the DiskUsage application (system data takes about 800 MB of my 1 GB of phone memory). I saw this to be a known problem due to some log files that keep increasing indefinitely of size. In order to delete them, it is suggested to type in the code *#9009# and select from the menu "delete dumpstate/logcat". However, when I type it I see "invalid MMI code". Any suggestion on how to delete these logs? I'd like to avoid rooting. On the web I found that factory reset does not solve the problem permanently but it only frees space temporarily, since after reset the system data keeps growing. Therefore, I need a one-click solution that I can use whenever the system data becomes too big.

When it came back up, all the apps on my SD card no longer worked. Their icons became generic with a tiny SD card in the bottom corner. When I tap an app, I get the message "Application not found". I've tried un-mounting and removing the SD card, restarting, clearing cache, but nothing works. When I go to the App Store, the apps show up as if they need to be installed but when I look at the SD card via my PC, all the files are there still. The pictures and videos are still accessible from the phone however. Before that, I had problems moving a game to the SD card. I kept getting a "Not enough memory" error, even though all the other movable apps moved and I deleted apps to make space. I tried options I found on the forums and other websites but to no avail, and the only thing I haven't done yet is to root my phone, which I am trying to avoid.

0	Is there a way to back up a device so it can be executed in a virtual Machine (without rooting)?	backup virtualization	The question is thus: It is very plausible for an android user to want to back up his information... completely. In this case, I'm wondering if it is possible to backup an android device in such a way that the OS which resided on it can be executed in a virtual machine. (There may be limitations inherit to the virtual machine, those are not the focus of this question and would perhaps even be outside it's scope.) However, there is a caveat: I wonder if it is possible to do this without rooting. There are numerous other questions along this vein, but none seem to provide a system-wide satisfactory solution. Answers requiring rooting would be acceptable for edification (plenty who may want to do this have likely rooted their device). However, for the preferred aspect of the question... I wonder if this can be done without rooting . A partial solution of this can be found here: with this question. The accepted answer is intriguing. However, one good reason too root an android device is to examine it for spyware at a later time . (For example: let's say I'm signed up for a security class, and my professor would be willing to help. Later, and who wants to root a suspect system?) And at the very least, the solution to that question needs serious clarification. Are the gaps in the backup mentioned by the original poster the only gap in functionality? I realize that the last end of this question could be construed as mere clarification on the referenced one: if you look at the number of upvotes, I think you'll find this to be of very broad interest.

When I am typing a word I use uncommonly, that is short and spelled correctly it will replace it with some bizarre acronym. More frequently when I am typing a common two/three letter word it will replace it with a stupid acronym - one that I would never chose to use. This habitual replacement of short words is becoming increasingly frequent as the system thinks I want to say VFA when I poorly type the word if or IRS when I try and type its. How can I remove these pestilent acronyms at a system level so they never darken my doorway again?

I got everything back on it the way I like it, adjust settings, put GPS to high accuracy, but the problem is still there.

0	Android detects bluetooth gamepad as mouse	bluetooth gamepad mouse	A couple of days ago I bought a bluetooth controller(Steelseries FREE Mobile Wireless Controller), but unfortunately my tablet detects it as mouse(I can move pointer with left analog etc.). I have written a message to support, and they replied that they are sorry but there's nothing they can do...So I decided to fix it myself. Some games that support keyboard controlling I can play with an app called Bluez IME. But all of the other - not :/ I started logcat in terminal and I've discovered that after I connect my gamepad, it loads hid-keyboard layout and says it's "keyboard mouse" Below is photo of terminal with important part of logcat(Sorry it's a photo - I'm in a hurry) So my idea is to load my own prepared key layout file instead of hid-keyboard.kl, but I don't know how to achieve it.Any help would be appreciated :) EDIT: dmupsys input also didn't give me a lot of information: device is called hid-keyboard(while on my phone it's full name of device), its Identifier is:"bus=0x0019, vendor=0x0000, product=0x0000, version=0x0000" - that's why my configuration file didn't load, but I can't call it "vendor0000product0000.kl", because my tablet sees a couple ofother devices with this identifier :( My guess would be that it's some system app that hijacks input from gamepad and gives me mouse pointer - it would be fine, but when I enter some game, it's still a cursor :&lt;

I already have terminal emulator installed but I need full Linux. 2) Does this app install Linux with gui etc on tablet or does this only install terminal kind of environment and uses remote login (like splashtop) to access a pc with linux and then display screen on our tablet ( I dont want this) ? If it does not, then is there a way to get full Linux with vi, libreoffice etc etc on android ? Thanks. 
0	Problems using bluetooth tether on a cheap chinese tablet	4.2-jelly-bean bluetooth-tethering	I'll save you all from the backstory, because I am short on time. I have 4 iDeaUSA CT8 cheap chinese tablets running android 4.2.2 that I bought from fry's electronics for $99. It was a great deal, and the tablets are surprisingly good considering the price and power.Basically, I need to bluetooth tether tablets to smartphones (or any other cellular device) for use in a venue where wifi is banned. However, the tablets will not work. I have followed instructions for bluetooth tethering, and the tablets act like they are connected and everything but when I try to load google.com it just loads for a couple minutes before timing out. It happens on any device I try to connect to, including a GalaxyTab 3, Droid Turbo, and another off-brand. I know the problem is with the tablets because I can follow the same steps on my phone and other tablets, and it works just fine.I have seen some evidence of similar stuff, but have found no working solution.What do I do?!? I have 3 days to get this working, and I don't want to resort to reverse usb tethering to a laptop. Is there some sort of glitch with the software that is patchable? I doubt it is hardware, because everything looks exactly like a working setup. 
0	Google Tasks not syncing (events do) on the phone	cyanogenmod sync calendar google-tasks	I have a OnePlus One running CyanogenMod 12. I started using tasks within Business Calendar 2 PRO app heavily. They synchronize using google tasks. So I can see my tasks in google calendar. This works well with my Nexus 7 2013 tablet and PC and worked well with the phone too. The phone recently stop synchronizing correctly and does not want to work again. Screenshot - Sync (Click to enlarge image) I noticed that arrows stay present after trying to sync the Calendar. First they wiggle instead of turning awkwardly and end up staying there. The events get synced, the tasks not. I also have a "Sound Search for Google Play" syncing problem, but I turned that one off for the reason so that it does not interfere. I have no idea what to do. Once I had a similar problem with Google Keep and I managed to find a card that was causing some db problem on google site - I removed it and synchronized and it started working again. But I could not see anything interesting in the logs this time.

0	Program named -2068	applications 4.4-kitkat youtube cache	I noticed in Data usage, under Wireless &amp; Networks, an app named "-2068". Does anybody know what this is ? It does not come up when I run ps command from terminal, so the number it's not a PID . The only thing I can think of it's that it might be something related to the HTTP/1.1 protocol, which RFC is numbered 2068 . Android version 4.4.2 EDIT:I discovered some more objects in settings > wireless &amp; internet > data usage , which are named always with number. After I searched with find and grep some of the numbers, I discovered that the youtube app is caching some files named with numbers, the first 5 or 7 digits of which, correspond to the objects in the data usage table.For example the query find /|grep 13129 returns: /data/data/com.google.android.youtube/cache/-1312918702.cache from the search command I omit the '-' , but as you can see it's present in the file name. Now I'm asking to myself: why in the world the data usage tab would show some files downloaded by YT, as they were some apps using internet resources ?

0	Inconsistent SIM-Card problem	samsung-galaxy-s-4 sim-card	Three days ago, I dropped my Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9505 straight on its back from about 1 meter height. After that, the SIM-card slot apparently stopped working. After trying out my mother's SIM-Card, it did however work. My simcard also worked in her phone (S4 mini). My simcard was not detected in my phone and there was a notification that said that there was no sim-card detected. I ordered a new SIM-card. I received it today. When I got it, it still didn't work. It, however, didn't show the "simcard not detected" notification, on rare occasions it did. After waiting a few hours it started allowing me to type in my PIN. After typing the PIN, the phone shows a warning that the SIM-Card is not detected and requires a reboot. How can I get this working again? 
0	Galaxy Nexus Not Responding To Anything	samsung-galaxy-nexus boot	So I was recently messing around with my Galaxy Nexus and I attempted to wipe everything but accidentally wiped the OS. I tried adb'ing a ROM to the device but it was getting halted at around 5MB (the ROM was around 200MB). I turned to ODIN and that failed for some reason and lead to the bricking of my phone. I attempted to unbrick it following a tutorial on XDA forums but that just led to my phone having a black screen and nothing being displayed as well as my computer not responding to the device. I have tried this as suggested by many people: Remove USB and battery Plug in USB Wait for windows recognition insert battery but nothing is happening. Windows responds to the device connecting but then says it doesn't recognise it and nothing happens. Any help on the situation

0	Does the Amazon App Store charge for updated apps?	amazon-appstore	We have a new Android phone to replace an older one, and we use Amazon App Store. We logged in with the same account on the new phone, and some of the apps show "Install". But other apps that we have purchased in the past show a price instead of "Install" -- they seem to have lost the fact that we already purchased these apps. For example: Polyclock World Clock purchased as a Free App of the Day (April 2012). This shows a price ($2.99) instead of "Install". However, if we click the price, it changes to "Buy" and then attempting to purchase, it says "You already own PolyClock World Clock -- please find it in My Apps." However we can't find it anywhere installed on the phone. This doesn't quite match the other similar situations I already searched for: logging into Amazon AppStore with different credentials messing with the apk? The inconsistent purchase behavior makes me think it's a bug... but my other guess was that the version of this app was so old that perhaps it thinks it needs to repurchase. I couldn't find information on Amazon matching this situation, although I might have missed it. There was a lot of information about transferring Kindle apps. Thanks! 
0	Nexus 5 Boot Loop and Cannot Flash It	nexus-5	Alright, so one morning when I was on my phone and turned it on, I realized that it was stuck on an infinite boot loop. I already installed Android Studio and all the relevant stuff needed in order to flash Android Lollipop 5.01 my phone. The problem is that my PC cannot recognize my Nexus 5 (recognizes it as an unknown device) and the fact that I cannot go to the settings in my Nexus 5 (infinite loop) to set up USB Debugging is making me feel irritated. I cannot update the driver (Yes, I have installed Google USB Drives). I could really use some help on this. I have already tried wiping the cache partition and a factory reset of the phone. update: Welp, I figured out the problem. I just had to flash it back to kitkat 4.4.4 though.

Differently from question Can I use multiple Android devices with a single Google account? I'm more focused on app for which I've paid to download them, and not simply in app sync. Since if this is possible, could it be a cracking mechanism? Meaning if a "buyer" account become public (username &amp; password) anybody can use it and download paied app for free.This could apply for example in a "family" environment for example, one accunt that pay for app and all people having the same account on their device. 
0	Strange "update twitter" notification	notifications	A few weeks ago, a new notification item appeared on my tray. It's worded in a way similar to normal update notifications, but it's not one of them, and it makes reference to software I haven't installed. See this image: The screen grab shows two standard update notifications: "X applications updated" and "X updates need approval". However, there's also a different one that reads "1 new update - Touch to download Twitter". Not only this one is different, the really strange thing is that I DON'T have Twitter installed, so there should be anything to update. Aside: I use a Twitter client, but it's called Tweet Lanes and it normally upgrades through the normal routes. This doesn't seem related. My tablet is a 2011 Samsung Galaxy 10.1, running Android 4.0.4. Maybe the notification is generated by the OEM software provided by Samsung? Is there a way to tell which programs are showing which notifications?

0	Is it possible to prevent numbers in text from being dialled	4.4-kitkat dialer	If ever I enter a number into an app within Android (4.4.2, Sony Xperia M2), the system seems to interpret it as a phone number. Therefore, if I try to edit that number, the system tries to dial it. An earlier, unanswered, question suggested that this happens on Google Keep. However, it also happens on the inbuilt Notes app, on Evernote and others, even numbers displayed on websites in the Chrome browser. Therefore, it isn't the app, it must be the OS. This feature means that keeping notes that contain a number is almost impossible. You can't edit a note without the thing trying to call the number. I can't find a setting that turns off automatic hyperlinking of numbers. Is there one? Is there a service running that does it? If so I'll uninstall the service.

I work at a library and we have Android Tablets for checkout for patrons to use and after the patron is done using the tablet we want to delete the username off any and all apps the patron may have used so that their username is not left on the app. I know the "Clear Data" button in Application Manager will clear the username but we would have to do this for every app and would rather do this in one instance rather then one at a time. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

It seems there is 4GB allocated to "Misc", which I'm guessing would be fixed by deleting the dump file, but for some reason I can't access the menu via *#9900#. Are there any other methods to doing this? (I do not keep media files on my phone at all and have already moved many of my apps to my SD card.

0	Understanding SDCard storage	sd-card storage mount sony-xperia	I'm trying to get more free space to install apps using Link2SD which require a 2 partitions sdcard, and that's what I tried to achieve. I connected my phone to a linux box with msc mode, and fdisked the sdcard and the first thing to notice was that there are no partitions there, but I could mount the device e.g. 'sdc' and I can see my files. The second strange thing was after partitioning the sdcard and writing changes, the sdcard can still mount the two partitions and write on them, and mount the whole device 'sdc' and read and write on it, that's kinda strange ! After disconnecting my device my sdcard still work correctly with full capacity but I cannot view files saved on the partitions e.g. 'sdc1'. Reconnected to my linux and fdisked again, but this time I created a new empty DOS partitioning table, this time the sdcard couldn't be mounted on the phone until I reformat it in the android system. Can anyone explain where did the files written on sdc1 go ? why aren't the partitions mounted in android ? how can I mount a device that is not partitioned ? and why the sdcard needs reformatting to reuse in android after changing partitioning table ?

I had to reset my phone as the Lollipop update didn't install correctly and was causing problems. I tried to sync and transfer my contacts to my car after performing a factory-reset and resetting everything back up. It will not transfer all contacts. I have tried putting my phone in safe mode and transferring to make sure that none of my downloaded programs were causing the problem. Did not work. Contacted Samsung and the guy in their tech department tried to tell me that since my contacts were saved to gmail that they would not transfer. He had me export my contacts to my phone and try again. Still didn't work. I tried to tell him that he is completely wrong as it has nothing to do with where your contacts are stored. He was clueless and said he would research and call me back tomorrow. Anyone else experience this? Know how to fix? Some contacts transfer but not all. No rhyme or reason to what doesn't transfer, I happened to notice because several are the people I add to my 'favorites' in the car. Assistance is appreciated.

0	How can I diagnose what is using my 3g connection in small packets	data-connection mobile-data data-traffic	My GSM carrier rounds all used data up to 100KB. Which means that if some app is sending/receiving 500 bytes, I get charged for 100KB. Lately I observed that I go through several hundred megabytes per day. Data usage in phone shows that I used ~ 400MB, while carrier charged me for over 2GB of data. In detailed billing I see literally thousands of short connections (multiple per minute, 24 hours a day), each using 100KB - which means that actual data transfer is much lower. Carrier helpdesk said that they can't tell me what I'm using the data for. Phone shows real data transfer, which in my case is useless. What can I do to find out what application/process is sending lots of small packets of data (or receives)? If it helps with anything, I'm using Motorola Moto G2 (only 1 SIM has data transfer enabled), and it's running Android 5.0.2. While debugging the problem, I disabled Google Backup Services from using 3G (only works over Wifi now), and an hour ago I disabled it altogether. But given that it was disabled over 3G, I don't think it's the culprit.

I rooted the phone months ago, uninstalled T-Mobile bloatware (using Titanium Backup Free), and have been enjoying using it for a while. Recently however, I haven't been able to power it off. Everytime I hold the power button and select "Power Off", it goes through the motions but then reboots immediately. I can't think of anything I changed during that time that would cause this, other than software updates. I couldn't tell you which software updates, because I didn't try to turn it off in a long while. Removing the battery and re-inserting it keeps it off. It's just using the "Power Off" command. Is there anyway I can get a log of what's happening during shutdown? I'm new to Android but not so much to Linux. 
0	Set up new device with very long Google password	google-account password accounts	My Google Account password is hundreds of characters long. It's intractable to type. That's normally OK, because I use a password manager, but I recently did a factory reset on a 2012 Nexus 7. Tap &amp; Go from my Nexus 4 phone copies all accounts, but asks for my Google password and I can't figure out a sane way to get my password to the device. Here's what I've tried: I actually tried typing it in, once. It took about 15 minutes and I got something wrong. I tried creating an App Password . The Nexus 7 said it was incorrect. I tried this several times, and I'm sure I didn't get the app password wrong, so I can only figure that app passwords can't be used to sign into new devices (?). I really don't want to change my Google password to something insecure just to get past this step. It shouldn't be necessary. At this point in setup it's too early to install a password manager, and even if I skip sign in now, I can't really install a password manager without access to the Play Store, right? Is there a way to get my password into this prompt without arduously typing hundreds of complex characters onto a tiny default keyboard? Perhaps a way I can get the password from the Nexus 4 using NFC or any other protocol, or trick the 7 into treating a device plugged into the USB port as a keyboard?

I can bypass this by getting one of the teachers to log me into their administrative accounts, but I don't want to have to do this every time. Is there a fix for this?

Since I was always told to not let battery down below 20% (correct me, if that's wrong) I was faced with two options in this situation: plug phone to charger and let it charge for entire night, leave it and let it down to about 10-15%, that is below wrong level for battery charge. I was always wondering, what option is best for my battery's life and phone's overall performance. Can someone provide information, which option is better in mentioned situation?

0	ZTE N9130: Video recorded, but doesn't show under Camera, Gallery or a Video player, though it can be seen under File manager	video zte-speed-n9130	My wife's phone is a ZTE N9130 and it has a rather odd problem when recording video. It'll record, but then the video doesn't appear in the camera application for you to review. In fact, no videos do. If you go to the gallery application, they aren't there either. If you go to the video player, it looks like no video again. But , if I go into the File Manager and navigate to SD Card/DCIM/Camera , then I can see them. You can then tap one and it'll run in the video player. This is really annoying. It seems like the camera, gallery and video apps are all missing the videos that are on the SD card. Any way to fix this? 
0	Left Alt on External Keyboard Helper for use on JuiceSSH and Finch	keyboard bluetooth external-keyboard	I like to use JuiceSSH to connect a remote machine which is running Finch .Finch uses Alt as its hotkeys prefix, for example Alt + n to go to the next window. I have an external Bluetooth keyboard which has a left Alt key and a right AltGr key. The AltGr key is working fine, my problem is with the left key. The only configuration I found in the Custom Keymapping is to put left Alt as left Alt modifier. But that's not what I want, I don't want left Alt to be a modifier, I want the application to receive left Alt as it is, so that I can use shortcuts like Alt + n , instead of getting the char . Basically, I want to be able to control Finch using the left Alt as the shortcut prefix.

0	What Could Cause System Apps to Run that Are Not Used	motorola-droid-razr dlna system-apps	When testing a widget I created, I wanted to make sure that it uses as little CPU power as possible. After some research I downloaded Watchdog to use as a monitoring tool, which works great. When I finished my testing I set the CPU threshold at 10%, just curious to see what process would randomly go above that level. One that exceeds the 10% threshold on a daily basis, at least a couple times a day, is com.motorola.Dlna . I know what DLNA is, what it's used for, and how to set it up but I don't use it, nor do I have it set up on my phone. I spoke with a Motorola support analyst and asked why it would be running. The response I got was "it's possible you could have set it up without knowing it, maybe by an application that you downloaded but it's nothing to worry about". Needless to say the answer I got wasn't very helpful so I'm really just wondering what would cause this service to use so much CPU power randomly? Most of the time it's not being used, but when it is, it shows that it's using usually between 12.5% - 15% CPU power. Do applications really access/use this service without me ever actually going through and setting it up? 
0	Device freezes after trying to reboot with bootloader	adb htc-desire fastboot bootloader htc	I have been trying to unlock my bootloader as per the instructions found here. I already have installed the drivers from Google USB driver folder that comes in Android SDK "extras" folder. However, when I try to start my device into the fastboot mode with cmd, it freezes. I type " adb reboot bootloader " to the terminal, as instructed. It seems to be trying to restart my phone, yet it freezes before it can actually start up, stuck on the initial HTC screen. Has anyone ever encountered an issue like this, or may anyone have an idea for a solution to this? I would manually enter bootloader menu and get my phone to fastboot if I could, but holding down the volume down and power buttons (as instructed here ) won't help me at all. Pressing volume down and power simultaneously will simply start my device with a regular boot (and I have no means to "deselect Fast boot" - I simply don't have the option in battery settings). I am on Windows 7 laptop and my phone is HTC Desire 516 using Android 4.3.

0	How to install Android Package manually (without Google Play, adb install, or "Install" click)	installation apk	 Backstory Before we get into question, I will explain what happened in my android. Earlier, I got random bug in my Android that causing my OS got "Half-restored factory settings." By the means Half-restored , some of my basic configurations are reverted to default (wallpaper, Settings, LINE, Facebook, Browsers, even Google Accounts) while some apps are not reverted. I wonder why. Then I found that all apps that I installed on SDCard are considered uninstalled by my Android, though the ASEC files are still there. And when I looked up into /data/data/ , all data are still there as well. Then, I tried to manually mount .asec files (tutorial here ) and successfully mount the .asec into /mnt/asec// . APK, data, library and configs are there as well, too. But unfortunately, even after I mounted the asec manually, it still considered not installed yet by OS. Question So those events and conditions raise me questions: Is there any command, or configuration/text that I can edit to make those mounted ASEC apps considered installed? How to reinstall those apps without losing orphaned data? (because if I reinstall the app, the app will go to /data/app partition and the /data/data will be overwritten) Thanks for reading, I'll look forward for the answer. Additional Info For additional info, I use ZTE N986 on 4.2.1 Android Jellybean OS (official stockrom), rooted (obviously) + Xposed. This acc
0	Need help tracking Bluetooth disconnects from car stereo	bluetooth audio music	Frequently when audio starts being transmitted to my JVC Bluetooth car stereo, my Bluetooth connection between the two is lost, the stereo sits there for about 20 seconds complaining about it, and then it finally reconnects. This is a constant occurrence. It's only when audio begins transmitting, and it happens intermittently. Once I get audio going, it's great, and as long as the stream doesn't stop, the connection doesn't go down. But if it stops for any reason, such as an incoming call, I pause to react to something else, it gets interrupted by some special type of notification, the podcast ends, etc., the next time any sound happens, such as a notification, incoming call, or me playing something, there's a rather high probability that it will disconnect. Sometimes it can be two or three times in a row before I can finally get it to stay connected. What I'm trying to determine is if this is an issue with my car stereo, or an issue with Android. I allow for the latter because years ago I used to keep my Bluetooth headset in my ear throughout the day and oftentimes when notifications would start, the headset would disconnect and reconnect. So there's precedence of this happening before, leading me to wonder if this is a larger Android issue. But that could also be coincidence. It's not my phone, as this has occurred through three devices, a Nexus 4, 5, and now 6, so their only shared feature is being stock Android, but running from Jelly Bean all the way through Lollipop with no change in behavior. I can't easily test this on alternate hardware as I have no comparable use case with anything else. I don't have another car, and I don't use Bluetooth speakers with the same sort of need for voice controls, navigation prompts, music, podcasts, and phone calls that occur in my car. So when I do use my Bluetooth earbuds, with which I don't notice any problems, it's not a direct comparison of methodology. So I'm looking for one of the foll

0	What is accessibility feature in Android?	tasker accessibility	I've seen a setting named Accessibility in my Android 5.0 and 4.2.1. I don't understand what it is and how can it be helpful to me? I would like to know what does it do? I noticed that there are options like Greenify and Tasker present inside it. Why are they listed in such setting? There is more about it that bugs me. I rarely use Tasker on my devices but it works well on 4.2.1. However, I noticed that on CM12 you cannot run a profile using Application context, unless you enable some kind of Tasker's accessibility service. I also found this question related but it is unanswered. Why is it that Tasker needs this accessibility service in 5.0 but not in 4.2.1? More so, how do I run Tasker with app context in 5.0 without enabling the said service, just like on 4.2.1. I seem to see some lags, though not very drastic compared to this question . 
0	how to 'cancel' automatic standby while reading?	settings standby	I look for an app/a setting that allows me to cancel/revert (automatic) standby more easily than by pressing the power button. I think of something like turning off the screen for a few seconds before standby, so i can cancel it by tapping the screen.Similar like the lock screen kicks in only a few secs after standby. WHY?When reading eg. webpages, automatic standby can be annoying. I need to press power, thats annoying. I don't want to change the standby timeout either. I don't want an app that permanently allows wake by tap/shake/proximity, as this potentially eats battery and unwanted wakeups.Also, an app to disable the auto standby is not good, i want the standby to still kick in, eg. If i fall asleep.

0	Block SMS without number	sms-blocking	In India, we often receive SMSs which do not actually have a number, but instead, have a name like 'VK-AMSWAN'. SMS blockers like Truecaller don't have any facility to recognise such senders, and keep asking for a number to block. How do I block such senders? I cannot blanket block all unknown SMSs because even banking information comes from such named senders. Edit: When using third party SMS apps like chomp SMS, there is an option to show contact number below contact name. Guess what it shows for the spam? VK-AMSWAN (name) VKAMSWAN (where the number shows up for other contacts) -_- Edit 2: Thank you so much for your suggestions, guys. :) But it seems SMS blocking isn't as well developed as call blocking is. Truecaller actually rejects spam calls without you ever knowing about them. No SMS blocker I've seen has this facility so far. All they do is receive the messages and hide them. If someone can locate a method to fully block spam SMS, please do tell. :)

0	Updating any app is retaining its older version?	application-autoupdate	I am using android 4.4.2 on my Asus Zenfone 5 (not rooted). It seems that when I am updating any app from play store, it is installing a newer version without removing the older version. Before updating total space occupied by all apps was around 400MB, after updating all the apps successfully the occupied space for apps increased to 1.1GB.

In this new account, the email app works fine in almost all ways, except that when you (for example) open the settings dialog, nothing appears to happen. It is only when you hit the 'back' button that the settings window appears. It's as if new windows are opening behind the original one rather than in front. Initially it looked like it was on the Email app with this behaviour, but this morning Evernote has started doing the same thing in that account. This is extremely annoying! It only seems to affect this new secondary user. Everything works perfectly in the primary account. I've tried searching for people having the same issue but have come up with nothing.

Apparently for security purposes it is not on the Play Store and when you subscribe they send you an SMS with credentials and app download link. I downloaded the app and used it. First time you launch it asks for credentials and activates your account, no login Activity, just the Activation Activity and then it goes straight to usual interface every time. So I accidentally deleted the app data (meant to delete cache) and now every time I launch it I have to activate my account, which won't activate because it is already activated !! I spoke to the bank customer service and they said I can only cancel subscription first before they send new credentials which is supposed to be done from within the app. So I'm stuck unless I can recover the app data. They are charging me for the service by the way. I am using a rooted Galaxy Note 8.0, is there any way I can recover the data ? Preferably for free?

I would like to know from where FWUpdate is checking and downloading updates. Is it getting the information from the carrier? From the default Samsung repo? Possibly from a repo as configured by the store that sold it? How can one check from which repository is the Note checking for and downloading updates? Note that my goal is not "How can I get the update faster", but rather I'm actually trying to prevent the system from finding and installing the update . After installing Dcentral 1 I see that FWUpdate is trying to update itself at least once per day.

0	Android customization Galaxy Note	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich custom-roms backup samsung-galaxy-note	Recently, Android ICS has been released in my country (Hungary) also for the Samsung Galaxy Note. That's cool, the phone updated itself to Android 4.0.3 and at first sight it was really cool and fast. But...To be honest, the Wi-Fi disconnects and the battery gets empty in half of a day... These 2 make me really angry and I was thinking about rooting, which I have successfully done today, but it still didn't help at all on my problems. Okay, the UI might be a little faster... So. I thought I might have to change the ROM to a custom one. Now I have more questions about this: I wish to modify my phone on a way I can easily turn it back to the factory state (no wonder, warranty). How to do this/is it possible? Is it possible to "put up" more ROMs and when I'm turning on the phone just select the one I want to use (just like you'd install more OSs on a desktop computer)? I would also want to know what are my options for a custom ROM for a Galaxy Note WITHOUT losing my S-Pen functionality, so which ROMs should I count in? How to freakin' achieve these above questions if everything is ok? =D Thanks in advance! =) (Links and experiences are welcome also...)

0	How to stop Sony Xperia Z3 Compact making noise on using camera button?	5.0-lollipop sony-xperia-z3-compact	I've got a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact running Android 5.0.2, and is not rooted, which has a button that instantly wakes the phone going straight into the camera app. One problem - unless Media Volume is at zero, pressing the camera button makes a distracting and annoying tinkling sound. It does this despite the fact that : I already have "Sound" turned off in Camera settings . This turns off noises like the shutter sound, but doesn't stop the camera button sound. It seems the phone thinks "camera sounds" and "camera button sounds" are completely unrelated things. I've turned off all the Sound options under the phone's system settings. How can I turn off this specific "camera button" sound? I've looked through the system settings but can't find anything relevant. Right now my "workaround" is to always turn media volume to zero after every time I do something which uses it, but this is far from ideal. 
0	---What checks should I go through if my laptop can't connect to the internet through tethering?	tethering wifi-tethering usb-tethering	I need to connect my laptop to the Internet by tethering through my smartphone, I'm using a Galaxy GT-S7270 with Android 4.2.2, a laptop with Windows 7 and a tablet with Windows 8. Whenever I try to use the WIFI hotspot, while I can connect and access the internet with my tablet the laptop gets a limited access after connecting to the smartphone. This behavior stays the same of I try to tether form another device, like for example my roommate's I-Phone or a WIFI signal coming from it laptop through a certain software (which in fact doesn't work for my tablet either). If I try to use USB tether, as soon as I activate it from the menu in Android, the file manager of Windows doesn't list my device anymore, if I deactivate the USB tether the device is listed again. This happens for both MTP and PNP protocols, in addition the PTP protocol trigger a warning saying that there are problems with the drivers of the device. The laptop doesn't have a Bluetooth transmitter. I won't have access to any other access point but the smartphone for a while, what can I do to connect my laptop to the internet? EDIT: I had success downloading some unofficial drivers from the Internet and using them to make a USB tether. Still, the same drivers don't work on the tablet and the whole process has been a series of random attempts. Since I still don't have a "method" and the reasons of a certain connection working on a certain device and others not working, I will leave the question here.

I understand that there is an option to change the date range in the options, but this is more time consuming and you need to change it every time you want to show a different range- the slider was so much easier and faster. Is there any way to bring this back or perhaps an app that has this feature?

0	Text messaging so slow it is nearly unusable	sms performance	I have a Galaxy S5 running 4.4.2. I am trying to send a text message to a certain contact. When I select their name from the list of messages, there is a 30 second delay. While typing, sometimes there will be a 10-15 second delay for each letter. If they send me a message while I'm trying to type, there will be a 30-60 second delay. Texting this person is so slow it is almost unusable. Other contacts are slow as well, but still usable. This is with no other apps running. My guess is that this could be caused by the lengthy text message history for this particular contact, but I doubt this is the case for the following reason: It seems extremely unlikely that I should be unable to store and display several megs of text on hardware made in 2014. I want to preserve this text history in any case, but I don't necessarily need to display it all on the screen at once. Thanks!

0	Hangouts application not always suggesting my contacts when searching	google-plus-hangouts google-contacts	I store all of my contacts under Google Contacts, which my Android phone uses/syncs (i.e., the Contacts application lists these, and only these, contacts). I recently searched for "sergio" under the 2nd tab of Hangouts by clicking the "+" button to generate a new SMS message. I have at least one contact with this matching first name, yet Hangouts only suggests random strangers with this name, none of which are my contact. After this failed, I used my Contacts application to find his record, where I clicked the sms/message icon. This redirected me back to Hangouts where an existing SMS conversation was loaded. Subsequently when searching for "sergio", Hangouts now lists my contact under Phone Contacts, ahead of the random strangers it lists below that. For other contacts, they just show up when I search. I can't find any difference between those contacts that don't show up and those that do. Any ideas if this is a bug or a feature? If it is a feature, how can I get all my phone contacts to always show up before random strangers when searching?

0	Is there a way to map/translate a pattern-lock to a numeric PIN?	4.4-kitkat encryption pattern-lock	I just encrypted my Moto X (Gen 1) (KitKat 4.4.4) using the default encryption option from the Settings > Security menu. After the encryption process finished, it asks me, "Type password to decrypt storage". Only there's one problem: it never asked me for a password. It seems I'm not the only one who experienced this. I've tried my Google password like 3 times, and, like that other poor soul, I haven't been able to find a way to map my pattern-lock to a PIN, which might be what Android used for the encryption. For the mappings, I have tried a standard phone dial pad: 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 and a standard keyboard numpad: 7 8 94 5 61 2 3 and a wild guess based on how a developer might do it: 0 1 23 4 56 7 8 Presumably, though not necessarily, Android stores that pattern as a string or number somehow. Given a certain unlock pattern, how do I find the string or number that represents that pattern? To the moderators: I'm fine deleting this question if it's not on-topic. I think the question would have been on-topic if the answer fixed my problem. I'm not sure how you guys see that.

So others get this type of messages, too (where a phone was mentioned it seemed also to be a Galaxy S4). But the posts/questions/answers were always about something else. It looks as if everybody ignores this kind of messages as noise. I played around a bit and noticed this: As long as the phone is active those messages do not appear. But when I switch it off, the messages appear about every 10s. Does anybody know what they mean?

0	How do I get a ROM onto my ICS (Android 4.0) tablet?	usb rom-flashing rom samsung-galaxy-tab-10	I have a Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I decided to root it, that went fine. Then I decided to upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich. That also went fine. It was only after upgrading that I discovered the camera does not work (yes, the warnings were there, but they weren't made very obvious). That sucks, so I wanted to go back down to an earlier version. I seem to have lost the ROM for my earlier version on the tablet, so I went to copy it back to my tablet, thinking that would be simple... But ICS doesn't let me connect to my computer via USB. After looking around the web, this is apparently because of a change in the way ICS is going to handle USB connectivity, which is an issue I don't want to embed myself into. All I know is I want to get out of ICS and back to Honeycomb. How can I get the ROM onto my tablet so that I can install it?

0	Is there an easy way to update my HTC Evo 4g to ICS?	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich updates htc-evo	I just got a Sprint HTC Evo 4G, and discovered it is running Android v2.3.5 (Gingerbread). I manually checked for updates, which downloaded the latest security patch for 2.3.5 Gingerbread, but did not update it to a newer major OS version. I did some searching about updating it to a newer Android version, but most of the articles I found either have dead links or require climbing up a steep learning curve to root and then flash(?) the device. Are there any methods for easily updating to (ideally) Ice Cream Sandwich, without needing to learn the software innards of my device?

I've rooted it, and before i send it in for repair, i'm trying to debug the issue (in hope it's only software).

(Ironically on the day the Prime is officially released/announced. Oh well). It came with Android 3.1 per the Settings page. I tried Settings: About tablet: System Update and am told there are no updates available. I read that 3.2 is available on these devices. (I know 4.0/ICS is still a future thing). How do I get to 3.2 on this device? No obvious downloads on Asustek web page. I am on my WiFi at home, checking mail, downloading apps, etc. So how do I troubleshoot why the Over The Air upgrade did not show an available update, when there has been one available since early 2011 (many moons ago). I am logged in to my Google Account. (I have my Gmail, Google Voice, and Youtube accounts all connecting ok). What else can I check or look at, to understand why the OTA upgrade is not being made available.

0	local cloud storage solution	linux storage cloud	I have got a 1 terabyte external hard drive, and I would like to find a seamless way for my android device (an HTC one mini) to be able to access that hard drive. In the old days when I wanted to do "cloud", I would plug such a device into my always-on-always-connected-to-the-internet linux and just share the device -- let other machines mount it. Of course this still works fine -- but I don't know how to do this via Android, or via Windows. Nowadays we have cloud solutions like Dropbox, which works great on my Android device, but I have limited storage space (unless I pay -- but I already paid for the external hard drive). Ideally I am looking for something with the simplicity of Dropbox but with everything under my control. I considered git for a while, and there are ways to get an android device to run git, but you seem to only have a limited end-user experience, and you seem to have to actually upload projects rather than being able to access them from afar -- and my android device doesn't have that much memory. I tried sparkleshare, but I can't find a client for Android. I tried every option that ES File Explorer offers, but they all seemed to involve losing control of the cloud storage. Is it possible to do this via LAN somehow? The problem is that my Android device will typically be moving from wireless network to wireless network and will not always be on the same network as the external drive. Basically I think I am asking for a way to plug a terabyte hard drive into my phone in a wireless way. This problem has surely been thought about seriously!

0	Why does the Kernel and Android System/Android OS drain my battery?	battery-life kernel	3 hours since unplugging my phone, and at light usage it's at 61%. It is the kind of problem I've had with my previous phone, and I have with my current phone, often starting a few months in and intermittently. GSam indicates that app usage is 88% of it, with Kernel (Android OS) being 38% and Android System being 21%. I know it is probable that "some apps" are using some OS functions and that would be the culprit. Seeing it's a problem that hasn't been solved in more than a year, (even in Lollipop) I'm submitting it here so there's a definitive place to show the solution when it's found, instead of checking endless forum threads on XDA. (Hence note the answer must offer some kind of solution instead of "it's impossible") I am not willing to take stabs in the dark such as disabling Google Now or Location tracking without a definitive proof. I have Wakelock Detector and it does not show anything unusual. How do I definitely find out which app is responsible for the drain?

0	Manage files left by uninstalled apps?	sd-card file-management	I just realized that when an app has the "SD card access" it has access to the entire SD card and all the other apps that use the SD card. I would have assumed that each Apps data is "sandboxed" like on an iPhone. So, once I delete the App that accessed the SD card I noticed that it doesn't always delete the corresponding files it created on the SD card. In one case I installed a Linux Emulator that created 4 gig file and when it came to installing the rest of the Linux it failed. So naturally I uninstalled the application. Out of curiosity I looked on the SD card found the file in some randomly named directory. So the big question is, is there a way to manage the deletion of those files as opposed to having to check your entire SD card everytime you uninstall an Application? PS: My device is Rooted

They are often posted on xda-developers without much information for newbies, like here . Since I've never done it before, I thought I would ask for some information. Can I just choose a modem and install it on top of the custom ROM that I'm using? Or do I have to get a ROM that has the correct modem inside? This is the rom that I'm currently using which works fine for my device.

0	something permanetly reset my email accounts from installed mail applications (Samsung Note II stock and Gmail app)	email gmail google-account	I've met with a very annoying and strange issue regarding email applications on my Samsung Galaxy Note II. My search in Google across multiple Android forums has has not given any result. I used for about a year on this device Samsung's stock email application to work with my mail accounts at some local mail servers and Gmail server. Also I used Gmail stock email app to work with my several Gmail accounts (some of them are the same as in Samsung's stock email app and some are different). One nice day several weeks ago I've suddenly disclosed, that all my mail accounts in the both apps are totally removed, that is all accounts settings and data (incoming messages loaded in the local cache, my drafts etc). When I called any of these two app, it starts as the very first time, that is offers me to configure any account before I can start using the app. Futhermore, the default Google account in the general stock settining ssof the account has been removed too. I have restored all accounts in the both apps and the default Google account in the device`s general settings. But several days later I've suddenly found out, that the both apps had reset and were empty again. Well, I've configured them once more... and now they are empty again. I suppose, that this issue is very probably conncted to the fact, that I use the same Google account as default account on two different Android devices, that is Samsung Galaxy Note II and LG G-2. Well, I have read here at the forum many different topics with the same questions, whether it is OK to use the same Google account as a default one on multiple devices, and the answer was always "Yes, without any problems". But seems, that the matter is not so simple. Anyway I can not imagine any other reason for such strange behaviour. Furthermore I suspect, that the problem occurred the first time after I've bought and configured my second device LG G2. I'm not 100% sure, but it seems to be so. What seems to be essenti

Everything was working okay until all I noticed that I'm no longer getting Gmail notifications anymore. I tried following : Gmail won't sync (Android) - Gmail Help .

0	What are the privacy implications of using Talk-to-Text?	privacy voice-recognition	Given that the Android implementation of Talk-To-Text sends your voice to Google's servers, parses your speech into text, then sends the text string back to the handset, what are the privacy implications of using Talk-to-Text? Does this mean, for example, that anything that I say to my beloved Nexus One is stored on Google's servers? Do Google TOS refer specifically to this issue?

0	Where do these suggested contacts "from my adress book" come from?	contacts privacy	I recently bought a Google Nexus 10 and created a new Google profile (@gmail.com) associated to it. I never sent any email from it neither received anything except Google's welcome messages. I added two personal IMAP accounts (full of emails). Then I installed Twitter (I'm new to Twitter too) which suggested me to add contacts from my "address book", that are actually real people I know. Does Google look into my IMAP mailboxes to discover my contacts ? If not, how is it possible for it to suggest such friends ? (My address book is empty - the only existing contact is myself. I also have a Dropbox and Github accounts linked to Android, but these account doesn't store contacts.) I saw Where exactly does Android get its contact suggestions from? but my GMail address is totally new so nobody has it.

However when I am out, how can I transfer a file from my phone to my PC? I can access my PC using SSH, but then from the PC I can't access the phone for get file using SCP.

I've seen AndFTP but it only allows ftp in its free version.

How can I move this from the phone speaker to the bluetooth option? Are there any apps that can do this? The main criteria for this is to be internet free. If the internet is required I can just use the laptop for the music through Spotify or some other app(which i don't want to do)

0	Finding a way to create a WLAN between tablet and phone	wi-fi networking wifi-tethering usb-tethering	I currently own a nokia N900 and am waiting for the my pre ordered Nexus 7 to arrive. I was wondering because since android does not support p2p adhoc networking, as far as i know. Is there any way to create a private lan wirelessly over bluetooth? Maybe setup the tablet or phone as a wireless router? Also, I am also considering modding a usb cable to be able to plug into the tablet and phone, because from what i heard the tablet also supports host mode, and linux supports IP over USB. I just need an SSH connection between the two so nothing special as regards protocol usage. Thanks, and I hope i got my question across clearly. 
0	Sudden surge in network usage by unknown processes	4.4-kitkat nexus-4 mobile-network data-traffic firewall	Phone Details: Model: Nexus 4 (mako)Current ROM: Paranoid Android 4.3-BETA2Xposed Present? Yes I flashed the new Paranoid Android 4.4- BETA1 today and noticed my phone downloading something. I had not initiated any downloads, so I assumed it was just some app syncing. After about 3 minutes, it had downloaded around 50MB which seemed fishy. So, I assumed that the Paranoid Android build was buggy and switched back to 4.3-BETA2. However, the problem seemed to be infectious. On the 4.4-BETA1 build it was just one port which was used for downloading and it was the port for com.google.uid.shared:10050 . However, now there are several ports which are downloading. They're all apparently in the foreground. Any idea how I can find which app introduced them and remove them? As a temporary solution I'm using a firewall. Screenshots Screenshots (click images for larger variants)

It's just that for some reason, after I do a search, the root files suddenly (and mysteriously) fail to show up, and then I have to disable the "root" features on ES File Explorer and re-enable them in order to see the root files again.

0	How to explain rooting, recovery and custom ROMs to a beginner?	4.2-jelly-bean	 Possible Duplicate: What is the difference between: Rooting, Jailbreak, ROM, Mod, etc.? What is the meaning of flashing a custom ROM? What do root, flash, and ROM mean? I've got Dad a Galaxy Nexus as Christmas present. Being the obsessive tinkerer that I am, I already loaded CM10.1 nightlies on it. But I don't want to take care of the phone for ever. He's a normal computer user, not exactly a noob in gadgets, so how do I explain rooting, custom recvory and ROMs in clear, non-jargon language? Last time I tried to explain, he stopped me at custom recovery and said he's better off using what I loaded on his Galaxy Ace. The problem with that approach is that it leaves him incapable of solving all the minor niggles that come with custom ROMs. Also, I live on campus (college) and troubleshooting online would be so much easier if he knows the basics.

0	Replacing the dialer	4.4-kitkat dialer	I have recently replaced the stock samsung system on my note 2 with paranoidandroid, but I don't like the dialer. I have tried a few alternatives and found some I like, but none of them replace the bit that actually makes the calls. When I use, e.g. dialer one, I get a great interface that I like, but the moment I press the call or answer button it goes back to the original interface. Is there any way to completely replace it? 
0	Can I use Titanium Backup to migrate from a Galaxy S2 with custom rom to a new Sony Z1 Compact?	4.3-jelly-bean restore titanium-backup sony-xperia-z1	Next weekend I plan to buy a Sony Z1 Compact. Right now I have a rooted SGS2 with Android 4.3, custom rom (Avatarrom). I use Titanium Backup and this has always been great for restoring apps including their data, but that was always on the same phone. I think I'm going to root the phone immediately, connect my google account, reinstall all necessary apps from the Playstore, and then use Titanium backup to restore data only. I'm not going to install a custom rom right now I think. I wonder if this is going to work out, if you have tips, what the risks are, what to watch out for.

0	How to select file to attach to E-mail from "My Files"	4.3-jelly-bean	I'm using the stock e-mail client in Android 4.3. I have a file in my Downloads folder that I want to send in an e-mail. When I try to attach, it asks me where I want to get the file from. Most of the apps are unhelpful (Images, Video, Calendar, etc.) The only one that looks like is helpful is "My Files" which has an icon of a folder on it. Why it doesn't offer any of the File Managers I have installed, I don't know. But when I tap on "My Files" and it brings up a file explorer, I can navigate to the Downloads directory, but when I try to select the file to attach, it pops up a new "Complete action using" modal dialog. If I try to open it with anything, it goes to that app, instead of returning me to the Email app. There is a Cancel/Done selection in the upper right, but only Cancel is allowed. What do I need to do to cause a selection (so that the Done option is allowed) without it popping up something that prevents me from completing the action? I have already looks at the menu (no help) and have tried long tapping (does nothing until I release, then brings up the same modal dialog that a short tap does).

0	Enough space, downloads most of the app, then says not enough space	google-play-store insufficient-memory	So I'm trying to install a little game called Xcom: Enemy Within, Google Play store downloads most of the App- I'd say 99% at least...then it gives me an error and says there's not enough memory- I have about 338 MB left after that. MORESO- I have an external mini SD card that I want to put this on but it won't allow me to download directly to it.(Which- I must say is a dumb design oversight that...well the ability to do that has been around since Windows XP guys come on) so long-term it isn't going to be that big of an issue.

0	How to take a picture and uploading it with a comment to Flickr, Facebook, and Twitter?	camera facebook flickr	I am coming from the iPhone, and there was using an app called Camera+ , which worked well for my workflow. On Android, I am now looking for a way to: On the go, take pictures , and store them somewhere. (I don't care where they are stored, they could very well be in a private store specific to the app.) Allow me to go through the picture I took, delete the one I don't like, and for the others, enter a description , and upload them to a combination of Flickr, Facebook, and Twitter. I want to just enter the description once , click on checkboxes for Flickr, Facebook, and Twitter to select where the picture will go. I could do this with the standard Camera/Gallery, with the Flickr and Facebook apps installed, but it requires way to many steps. I'm looking for something simple, that allows for a fast workflow, not for an editing workhouse. Is there any solution out there that would allow me to do this?

0	Is there a service/application that will allow a "friend" to retrieve my location from my phone without my involvement?	gps geolocation	I'd like to allow my wife to query my location whenever she's curious. There are no trust issues here, so I don't care about acknowledging/approving her "ping" request, whenever she wants to know she can just request my location details. Is there an app or service that does this? Most of them (understandably) require that the handset owner allow/permit the request, but I'd like this to happen without my involvement (say I'm busy at the office, driving, or getting groceries). 
0	How do I cancel a half completed email configuration?	email encryption	Phone is trapped trying to encrypt my device against my wishes. On my Nexus S I was recently upgraded to 4.0.4 and decided to try adding my work email to my personal phone. This previously didn't work because Android didn't have the proper security settings. I previously did not have any other email accounts setup. Did an manual setup for an Exchange server and it prompted me to give the email app additional permissions (enforce lock screen, full device encryption etc.) I accepted and configured the lock screen as requested. The full device encryption page popped up and it informed me that once encrypted I would not be able to decrypt the device without a factory reset. I was not interested in that, but there is no cancel button on the encryption warning page. I quit to the home screen, but now the phone constantly reminds me to complete the account setup. Is there a way to cancel the account setup? What are my options? I'd prefer not to have to do a factory reset. Did Google really place the warning page in a time where it's already too late to do anything or have I missed some other way to cancel? Every time I open the email app it says that the email account requires I change my security settings. I can cancel and the app closes or accept and the encryption page appears.

From there I plug in and it goes slowly up to 80%, then instantly up to 100% again. Anyone fancy having a guess at what is going on here?

0	Why does my EVO 3D think I am talking to it?	hardware htc-evo headphones microphone	Occasionally when biking or walking, something must be going on in my pocketses because my HTC EVO 3D keeps thinking my standard headphones are evolving into headphones with an inline mic. Normally I will be listening to music (Winamp) and the track will start skipping around; this is long after I have locked the screen and it has gone to black. I pull out the device and the headphones icon in the notification bar now have a mouth piece sticking out of them in the icon. I look at my headphones, they certainly haven't morphed in any way. I don't have bluetooth on, no other devices are connected to cause interference. What is going on with my phone and how can I keep it from happening? I don't mind forcing it to never be an inline mic'ed set of headphones if that option is available somehow; it's incredibly annoying 45 minutes into a ride and I would love to get this locked down.

I'm certain it was exchange because I have a traffic monitor tool and that particular email client is only holding my exchange account. This was, to understate, surprising. Is this normal behavior for Exchange? I only received 8 emails over night, none of which had any attachments to speak of.

0	Droid 3 Gallery Generating Errorneous Thumbnails; Possibly Due to Infinite Loop, .nomedia glitch?	gallery motoblur motorola-droid-3 thumbnails	I have a stock Motorola Droid 3 on Verizon. The device is not currently rooted. I am not sure if the Gallery app on my phone is specific to the Motoblur UI. I was testing the .nomedia trick/hack, by putting a zero-length file named .nomedia in my Downloads directory. I also cleared cache and deleted app data of the stock/standard Gallery app. it didn't appear to work, so I decided to say "screw it" and deleted the .nomedia file. Sadly this kind of ruined things. I reopened the gallery app started showing duplicates of most (but not all) of the images. If I clicked on one, it'd only load the thumbnail with just "loading..." ontop, like it was trying to generate the full sized image. If I long-pressed and clicked "photo info" gallery would crash. If I hit delete, it would delete the entry from the gallery view with no problem. The other one of the duplicates appeared to be the real image so it loaded no problem. Now, I could've manually deleted all the extra erroneous thumbnails, but that would be too time consuming as I had over 600-some correct images. So I decided to try a shortcut. I went to /dcim/.thumbnails and cleared the directory and I also went to /android/data/com.moto.blur.mediaprovider and cleared the thumbnails stored in that directory. When I went back to the gallery the situation got even worse. Now there's like 3 copies of the images. My prediction is that it's generating thumbnails, then generating thumbnails of those thumbnails. I tried clear the .thumbnails directory, which had over 2000 images in there. As soon as I restarted the gallery app, it'd fill right back up again. I tried the same process and rebooting, but again, starting the gallery app causes it loop with the thumbnail generation. I tried putting a zero-length file .nomedia into the .thumbnails directory but that didn't seem to be doing anything. Is there s

And I can communicate with it using TCP protocols. I can see that IP address when I use "ifconfig" command in terminal. But If it runs on Android, it doesn't obtain an IP address.

You need to use the "SkipSoft's S3 Toolkit", mentioned in the second article, but I simply jumped to the rom manager section, thinking I was done with rooting my phone. So I used saferoot, and then went on to the other guide and proceeded to install rom manager, and installed clockworkmod flash recovery, and tried to "reboot in recovery". Now after rebooting, it says "System software not authorized by Verizon Wireless has been found on your phone. Please turn off your phone and go to the nearest Verizon Wireless store for help." What can I do? I want to install the cyanogen custom root, but somehow need to backtrack to root my phone the right way. Is this possible?

Is this a known problem? What can I do to prevent it?

0	Why does phone reset to Gingerbread instead of the version of Android that came with the OS when it was purchased?	factory-reset	When I first purchased an Android phone over a year ago the installed OS was Android 2.1 (Eclair). The OS has been updated twice by the carrier since then and now runs Gingerbread. However, I had to restore my phone to factory settings recently and the OS that was reinstalled was Gingerbread. I was expecting it to restore back to 2.1 (Eclair). Is this expected behavior and was the phone reset properly to factory settings? I followed the hard reset instructions here and everything looked correct. However, this was not the factory restore I expected. If this was correct does anyone know how the Gingerbread OS "replaced" the OS that was installed from the factory? I thought the factory settings were "read only." Thank you very much.

When the browser loads http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js the actual code is different. See this screenshot (the green line is where ga.js should terminate): (and the added code goes on...) I initially thought that some malware changed the hosts file and assigned a different IP to the google-analytics website, but this is not the case since when I visit the above link directly I see the correct JS code. How can I track which app is doing this?

What do I want?: I want to make a Unity game for Android using the Wii Balance Board as a controller. What have I researched?: The Wii Balance Board uses standard Bluetooth to connect to the Wii. The board does not have a passcode. All results for connecting the board to an Android device points to two apps FitScales and WiiScale both not compatible with my device. I can't find any other results than these two apps. What's my question?: Why can't my phone (Nexus 4, Lollipop) connect to a device with no pin? (It prompts me to put in a pin and "OK" is greyed until I enter a pin). So how can I get it to connect to my Bluetooth? Other than Bluetooth, is there any other way to get information from the board to my phone? Notes: My Windows 8 can connect to my board flawlessly. Yes, I've tried tuning my phone and Bluetooth "off and on again". Yes, my Bluetooth works. Yes, my board works (like I said I could get input from it on my pc). My board does appear in my Bluetooth list. Any information is welcome!

In the past, this has always worked seamlessly. However, since my phone updated it's operating system to version 4.0.4 last week, caller ID is no longer working.

I then downloaded a factory image of Nexus 7 for JB - 4.3 (JSS15R) [This said razor which I dunno why. I thought it was flo] Anyway I took the factory image. Split the boot.img file into the ramdisk.gz and zImage. Then I got the zImage from the kernel I build and replaced it with the zImage from the factory image. The I combined the zImage and ramdsik.gz to create the boot.img and tried to flash it. But the device goes into a bootloop. The zImage works when I build android 4.3-JB from source. But aosp seems to miss some packages I need. I wanted to know what I'm doing wrong and why android goes into a bootloop when I combine it with the factory image

0	Android phone will not show all WiFi access points	wi-fi 4.1-jelly-bean	I have a LG-D686 running its stock factory installation of Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean; modified somewhat by the vendor to support a dual-active SIM card transceiver. Normally this phone has had no difficulties finding and connecting to WiFi Access Points. However, I now work in an office whose WiFi Access Point is not showing on my Andoid phone . This is what I know: The office WAP is not an ad-hoc wifi hotspot. It is an always-on Linksys LAPAC1750 Pro . The office WAP is visible from my Windows 7 work laptop and from other colleagues' iPhones. I've not checked if anyone has an Android Jelly Bean phone in the office. My Android shows up most but not all access points in the building. There are approximately 15 - 20 access points visible from my Windows laptop using Xirrus Wi-Fi Inspector; depending on the time of week. Android Wifi Analyzer shows that as much 80% of laptop-visible WAPs are visible on my phone. The office WAP has a decent signal; more than most WAPs that are showing up. If I create a non-ad-hoc wifi hotspot on my laptop (using Connectify); this hotspot will be visible if the laptop is not in the office and invisible if the laptop is in the office! No obvious and evident differences between visible and invisible WAPs other than the office access point is the only one in this building using channel 12. What might I do to resolve this WAP visibility problem?

0	Disable Carrier Phone Number for Google Voice Number	calls automation privacy google-voice call-screening	This seems similar to this question , but that one doesn't have a clear answer, and this is a bit different. Is there a way in Android to block all incoming calls that target the carrier number, but still receive calls that target the Google Voice number? General problem I'm trying to solve: I use Google Voice and all valid callers have that number. The carrier-issued number was previously used by at least two people who are being sought by many debt collectors, and has started to get a large number of calls from scammers. I have no reason to ever receive a call at this number. I currently use on{x} to manage various functions on my phone, but as far as I can tell, it does not offer a way to detect which of my phone numbers was called, only the number of the caller. I'm not sure if another management app (e.g. tasker or locale) would be more helpful, since I don't own either. I've been blocking numbers as they come up using AVG Anti-Virus, but since what I really want is a white-list for callers (those who know my Google Voice number) rather than a black-list it isn't really doing the trick for me.

0	Why does video screen get brighter and how to prevent it?	video screen-brightness vlc mx-player	This happens on Nexus 7 2013 (Google stock 5.0.2) and also happens on Galaxy Note 12.2 tablet (Samsung stock 4.4.2). I am in a dark room. I have set the system brightness to the minimum (let us call this brightness MIN). To change brightness I use swiping up/down on the left screen area. With MX Player, when the video starts playing, even the minimum brightness (which is 0) makes the screen brighter than MIN. There seems to be no way to set the brightness to MIN. I can clearly notice that the screen has been brightened, by pressing the home button or the task switch button. I can see that the screen remains bright for about 1 second then changes back to MIN. With VLC, when the video starts playing, if its previous brightness was 0, the brightness does not change and remains MIN. But if I change brightness once, changing it to 0 does not lower the brightness to MIN. At this point, VLC acts just like MX Player. Is this a bug of Android? It seems as if the system passes a false minimum brightness of the hardware to the software. Is this an intended behaviour to make video brighter? Anyways, is there any way to prevent this brightness change? This hurts my eyes when I watch videos in a dark room. ==PS== This behaviour is also happening in CyanogenMod 12 (Android 5.0.2).

I am curious if it is possible to disable safe mode in some way, or changing the button combination to enable it. I would also be fine with removing those applications from appearing in safe mode. I am new to rooting and such, and I would appreciate being able to remove access to these apps in the safest, quickest way possible.

0	Deferring GSM data connection	wi-fi data-connection	Frequently I am in the range of WiFi. Still when waking up my phone (Motorola Milestone) it usually makes a GSM data connection (visible in the top bar), and only after few seconds the WiFi connection is made. I understand that WiFi takes some time to connect to. Is it possible to somehow stop the GSM connection opening so quickly? I get billed for each such connection, and even though it is a very small price (0,01PLN/100kB), it is annoying to see all such attempts in billing, one by one. I think it would be enough if I could defer any internet connection for few seconds after wakeup to give WiFi channel to get opened. I do not want to block all GSM data connections, it would be a chore to unblock it when I really need it, and then I would keep forgetting to block it again when in WiFi range.

I didn't have this issue before installing CM, so I'm thinking it may be a CM sound. Basically, sometimes this sound keeps playing when I have my phone on loud.

It plays even when I'm not even touching my screen, and I think there is actually a small issue with my screen. I'm not too fussed about any issue with the phone, I just want to delete the sound so it can't play anymore! It really drives me mad because sometimes I can't have my phone on loud without this sound playing constantly. I tried looking and listening to all the sounds on my phone to try and find it, but I didn't have any luck. The sound can be heard here (at about 0:02):

Unfortunately most work only in a local WIFI network, real streaming of the android cam over internet seems rather tricky, but not impossible . I'm just interested to see a periodic image of a lab device (updated every 30-60 sec). Options like Google Hangout video chat or Skype video chat with two accounts would work, but the video quality is quite poor for this realtime solution, some images with adjustable resolution made periodically would be better and save battery ( this app might resolve this problem ) Teamviewer Quick Support looks nice, remote control &amp; view via PC of your android device, so I would just need an app that makes periodically an image: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm But is there an app that does this all in a more easy manner? Without starting several apps and hacks? Just making an image every 30-60 seconds and send it to imageshare service and update the browser tab on PC every 30-60 seconds. But the URL therefore should not change. Or giving the the android phone a IP via dyndns and run somekind of FTP server on it, where the image gets replaced on and on.

Now about Zimage to be renamed recovery.img ...that step I didn't do. Because that made no sense; first in the guide it said rename it if you are a Windows user but later on it says to use a file named that, so I had to rename it to the original. But I don't think this is the problem. I can't get into recovery mode, or start it normally. What I can do is go in download mode. Whenever I start it, it just shows a big "S" and the Samsung logo and stays stuck at that boot screen. It keeps flashing and then just stops flashing but after that the boot logo stays there.

0	How can I tell why my sleeping phone occasionally gets warm (and battery is draining abnormally)?	task-management battery-life	My two Android phones are doing the same thing, Motorola Milestone and Samsung GS3. From time to time, it is sleeping in my pocket and it will start to get warm and the battery is then draining quite rapidly. I guess it must be caused by an application that is stuck running in the background so I am checking: Task manager, but none of the applications seem to be using more CPU than any other, they are mostly all close to 0%. In "Battery Statistics" only "Phone Idle" shows quite high battery usage so it does not tell me if there is a problematic application. Currently I just reboot the phone to solve the problem but I would prefer if I was able to find the problematic application so I can close it. 
0	Android phone cannot connect to internet via wireless, other devices can	wi-fi connection-issues	I recently installed a new cable modem. After getting everything up &amp; running, I can connect to the wireless router, and then to the internet, through laptops, desktops, and a Roku device, but I cannot access via my Android phone. It connects to the router, but cannot get to the outside world. If I turn off the wifi, then I can connect via my data plan, but I cannot connect via wifi. Some details: The phone is a Samsung Galaxy S3, and the Android OS is 4.1.2 I use Comcast for cable internet. The (old and unchanged) wireless router is a Netgear device. (I am not sure the model number, but I can get it if that seems pertinent.) The new cable modem is also Netgear. It's model CMD31T and it is DOCSIS 3.0, while the old modem was quite old and I have no idea what it's level of throughput. I changed to the new modem because the old one was becoming "spotty" -- it would occasionally lose signal. The new modem has so far been consistently on, and with strong signal... it's just that the phone cannot connect to it.

It can't triangulate my position from cell towers because it doesn't connect to any. It can't triangulate my position from WiFi hotspots because it knows where i am even without hotspots around. Does it actually connect to a satellite to get my location like normal GPS units?

I did try out one when Android was version 1.6, but was dissappointed. I am interested to know if 2.2 or 2.3 is better. In particular, I use Gmail as my only email client. It operates all my email accounts (3 corporate and 2 personal). Every email is sent and received via the gmail server and is therefore filed and searchable in gmail. When I compose and email, I can choose which account to send it from and it comes via the domain server (i.e. not from gmail). My impresssion of android is that is can set up seperate email (pop, imap etc) inboxes and operate them directly with each domain server as pop/imap - but I don't want that as emails will not be kept on the gmail server and therefore filed, backed up and searchable from the webmail client. How does email account aggregation actually work in Android - is it true Gmail Webmail handling or is it just multi-account handling direct with domainemail servers missing Gmails servers in the process? Thanks

How do I see what I've ignored?	cyanogenmod notifications	When I tap and hold on a notification in the notifications list, I get an option to "Ignore messages like this." I can't find any explanation, though, of what this means. Does it really mean, ignore all notifications from this app ? Or does it mean, only ignore messages like this one from this app? (i.e. can one app have multiple "channels" or types of notifications?) And the other side of this - where can I see what messages I have chosen to ignore, and possibly undo it, if I once again want certain messages? UPDATE: In CM settings there's a "Notification Filter" screen that lists all notifications that I've chosen to ignore. (Settings > Privacy > Filter Notifications in CM11.) I still don't know what the filter does , though - it hasn't seemed to keep me from seeing any notifications. (I suspect that this feature only blocks you from seeing notifications whose source and content exactly matches a past notification, but I can't confirm that so I don't want to post it as an answer. Can anyone confirm or deny?)

My phone is not rooted. (Similarly, some files in my Downloads folder are not visible from Windows.) I've also begun having an issue where deleting folders in the "Music" directory gives an error "cannot delete _ the storage is write-protected.", but I don't know if this is related. I really need these recordings without having to "share" every single one of them individually in ES File Explorer. What is going on?

0	Unlock not working (ADB FLASH)	adb samsung	So I'm trying to flash adb my android (mostly following this guide ), and I'm getting stuck at the unlock device step. I can successfully unlock, but once I reboot my device it reverts to being locked. Apparently I'm unable to continue to the next step without having my device rebooted after it's unlocked. (I have tried using the volume keys to reboot bootloader, and terminal to reboot it. Neither work.) I'm using a mac, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and my initial problem was that my phone was (and still is) stuck in a reboot cycle. I'm pretty sure this was caused by trying to copy too many files to my android via USB cable (not the sd card, I don't have one). EDIT: So this is exactly what I've been doing. Open terminal cd to platform-tools, where I have an up to date adb, fastboot, and a zip file as well as the uncompiled version of image-yakju-jdq39 (Factory Image "yakju" for Galaxy Nexus "maguro" (GSM/HSPA+)). Volume up+Volume down+ power on (I get a screen with Fastboot mode in red at the bottom, and a picture of an android being operated on. I don't think it matters if I change the "start" thing with the volume buttons, but I'll keep it there.). Plug the USB cable in. ./fastboot devices, I get my phones serial number on terminal ./fastboot oem unlock. Terminal gives me this:...OKAY [ 10.016s]finished. total time: 10.016sWhile on my phone I get the unlock confirmation screen, which I follow through with, and now my phone says it's unlocked (and in blue at the bottom: Fastboot status - OKAY). ./fastboot reboot starts my phone, but it's clearly still stuck in a bootloop. So I forcefully turn it off, and go back to the fastboot mode, where it's back at the locked status. Is that sup

0	Is it normal for Android System to be the top battery user?	htc-droid-incredible battery battery-life	Over the past couple of days, the battery usage of my new phone has been as follows: 34% - Android System 28% - Cell Standby 21% - Phone idle 10% - Display 03% - Google Goggles 02% - Angry Birds 02% - Majesty This feels very off to me. I would have expected the games and display to rank much higher in terms of battery use. Could the high usage of Android System indicate a potential problem, or is this fairly normal? Additional information: I typically end up with around 15:00 hours uptime and 3:45 hours awake by the end of the day. Daily use so far includes short bursts of playing games and Internet use, but no listening to music. I haven't had a day of heavy calls/texting with the phone yet.

Instead of having various different gestures and shakes to trigger/change/alter/start something, it would be lot more easeir to just press the volume up and down buttons (or may be even different binary combinations of these two buttons).

0	Can an apk file be written to any type of NFC tag	apk nfc	Is it possible to write an apk file to a NFC tag for it to be downloaded when a user desires? bWe are trying to create a solution in which our reps in the field can simply turn on NFC in specific locations then download an apk file for our custom app. Normally simply providing a link to the file on our server would be ideal by using URI type of tag however these devices (Android phones) may not have WiFi nor Cellular data connection in order to install the app's apk file via a link embedded to the NFC tag. The NFC tags would be "installed" by a separate team. While it makes perfect sense to have our reps preloaded with the application, the consideration is to also allow customers to download the apk file for installation on their device if they desire as well. The apk is a 6 - 7 MB file.

There is also radio-crespo4g-d720sprkh1.img and bootloader-crespo4g-d720sprke1.img which I didn't put on the SD card (or maybe I did, but I can't see them from the install from zip section). Is there something else I am supposed to do with those files? Perhaps I am supposed to run fastboot before I go to recovery mode in CWR?

0	Can the on-board ADB Server find the device itself?	4.1-jelly-bean adb logging	I know that Android devices have an on-board adb server. I am able to start the server through the terminal emulator and run adb commands, but the device itself does not show up in the device list. The ultimate goal is to capture a logcat and store it locally, as I am having crashing issues that don't occur when it's plugged in, so I need to capture the logcat without plugging into USB. I want to ultimately be able to run $ adb logcat -v time &gt; /sdcard/logcat.txt and have it create the logcat text file that I can retrieve and view the next time the device crashes. I'm running Jelly Bean 4.1.2 EDIT I managed to track down a solution to my specific problem: Locally, adb is not required to gather a logcat. From within the terminal emulator, you can simply execute logcat &gt; /sdcard/logcat.txt to gather a logcat. However, I'll leave the question up in case someone figures a way to get adb to recognize itself, as it might be useful in the future.

0	T-Mobile Sidekick 4G Keyboard - Tilde and Backtick	keyboard t-mobile-sidekick-4g	I still have a G1. I love it for its keyboard. Nobody, has made a phone with a better keyboard. It has 5 rows and allows me to type the full ASCII range and then some. The keys are spaced apart and not easily fat-fingered like the Verizon Droid line of phones. I have been holding out on getting a new phone, waiting for one with a keyboard as good or even better. I had hope in the Sidekick, but upon closer inspection of the keyboard, it does not appear to have a back-tick ` or tilde ~ key. Where the back-tick should be, I see a smiley face. On Sidekick 4G keyboard, what is the fastest way for me to type a tilde and a back-tick? The person with the least amount of actions to accomplish this goal gets my vote.

0	Phone is slow to respond after waking up	samsung-galaxy-s 2.3-gingerbread performance	Many times when I unlock my phone to wake it up, there seems to be a lot of lag shortly after. For instance, simply trying to make a call or opening an app seems to take about 5 to 10 seconds or so. I can't really look at the memory usage or anything because it is only within the first 10 seconds or so. For the most part, other than this short time period, operation of the phone seems fine regarding speed. This behavior seems to occur more frequently when I leave an app open, such as a messaging (Handcent) app or Browser. Is there a way to identify what is slowing my phone down? I am running a Gingerbread 2.3.3-based ROM on a Samsung Galaxy S (Captivate). Edit to add: Steps I've taken so far: Removed any widgets No longer use Live Wallpaper 
0	How can I force-disable all dock detection/HDMI connectivity?	4.1-jelly-bean hardware motorola-droid-razr hdmi docking-station	 Context: I have a RAZR MAXX XT912 with 4.1.2 (3.0.8-gbacb1cf). As soon as I wake it for any reason, it immediately acts as if it is connected via HDMI, despite the fact that no cable is connected. Many people have this problem, and it is usually a result of a software issue or a shorted connection somewhere in the HDMI hardware/plug that results in a phone thinking it is docked. For me, it occurs constantly (some people experience it intermittently)--as soon as I wake the phone from sleep/non-lit states, it immediately rotation-locks itself into widescreen and presents me with the docking choices menu. Question: Is there some way to permanently disable HDMI dock detection? What I've tried: I've tried the "HDMI Connection" setting; whenever I uncheck it, the phone goes back to normal. However, leaving it unchecked doesn't work: if I restart the phone with it unchecked, the phone acts as if it's docked when it starts again, and I have to go into settings, check the box again, and then uncheck it before the phone behaves. The phone also periodically "forgets" what that I've unchecked the setting (without a reboot), and I have to go check/uncheck it again. I've tried clearing all application caches, to no avail. I tried clearing the cache partition, to no avail. Finally, I tried a factory reset, but the symptoms persisted. I've fiddled around with a hand lens and a needle inside the HDMI connector, but couldn't observe any shorted pins and didn't manage to affect the symptoms at all. 
0	Fresh Cyanogenmod install, location doesn't work	cyanogenmod geolocation	Yesterday I installed Cyanogenmod using the one click install on my Nexus 4. There is a little problem though: when using location in the battery saving mode, when it only uses cell and wifi signals to guess your position, it simply can't locate. Using GPS is fine, it locks position within seconds, but it's too battery hungry, kills my phone in a few hours. Is this a known thing? Can it be fixed? EDIT: After 2 days, location in power saving mode comes and goes.

0	Default launcher app hangs at boot up. Unable to do anything with phone (NexusOne)	nexus-one launcher	My NexusOne's builtin launcher is suddenly hanging at bootup. Since the main lock screen is hanging the screen touch is not working, soft buttons are not working -- I am just completely unable to do anything with the phone. When I tried calling the phone the call comes through, and I see the "Activity Launcher is not responding. Force Close?" popup, but when I force close it and the call ends, it goes back to the hanging lock screen and once again I am able to do nothing. Since it is stuck at lock screen there is literally nothing I can do to kill it or try other apps or settings or anything else. Even connecting USB cable didn't work since I need to enable USB storage from the notification bar and the hanging lock screen wont allow any touch response anywhere... What can I do or try? I guess hard reset is an option to try, but I want to keep it as a worst case option. 
0	Gingerbread has drastically reduced my battery life	2.3-gingerbread battery-life	I have a Nexus One, and since upgrading to 2.3.3, my phone lasts several hours less compared to 2.2.x. I've swapped out to a new battery, which didn't make a difference. In about 14 hours (of nothing more than texting), my phone is at less than 15%. When I check the Battery use under Settings, Android OS is always the top battery consumer. What can I do about this? Every other update besides this one has been great, but Gingerbread is a total disappointment. Update: This is 100% an issue with wifi. After disabling it, the battery usage of Android OS has dropped from 40% to 2%. After 16 hours on battery, it's still more than half charged. I'll keep investigating...or revert, because I think Gingerbread just looks fugly.

0	Nexus S 4G: Use wifi for LAN, 3G/4G for WAN?	wi-fi samsung-nexus-s networking	I'm developing a remote control app that will use wifi to communicate with my car stereo. The car stereo has ethernet, and I have the ethernet wired to a wireless AP in my trunk. This works great, but since the phone has a wifi connection, it wants to use it to reach the internet, which it can't do when my car is away from home. What I'd like to do is develop a script that I can run to route LAN traffic through wifi, but WAN (internet) traffic through the cell data connection. I dug a bit into this issue, and found this , but it doesn't seem to work, even after adjusting the routing table with a default route through the rmnet0 interface and bringing up the rmnet0 interface with ifconfig. It kinda seems like something in the OS is disabling the 3G hardware when wifi is active. Is that a known behavior, and if so, does anyone have any pointers on how I can circumvent it? I found this post where someone got working on a different phone. Can this be done on the Nexus S? 
0	Reset individual app settings	applications settings crashes	Something happened on my HTC Tattoo (V1.6) this week that caused lots of apps to crash on start-up. I think it may have been due to their settings getting corrupted somehow, but I don't know what caused that. I've been able to get some working again by uninstalling them and then installing them again. Obviously I lost any set-up by doing this. Is it possible to reset the settings for a given app? I don't even know where they are stored. Is it in an .xxx type file as on Linux? It would be useful to know where they are so I can back them up in future. Update August 2011: Now it's happening again. Google apps failed first, but then Facebook and last.fm stopped working. Tried clearing data/cache with no improvement. Can't re-install some apps as they are no longer available for 1.6. I do intend to try upgrading when I get time.

0	Improving Galaxy Nexus's audio quality	audio samsung-galaxy-nexus	I found out about this website through androidguys.com and I'm giving it a first shot. :) I remember when I had my Fascinate which is Samsung Galaxy S, I had Voodoo Sound Control app which helped to improve the sound quality tremendously. So you can imagine my surprise that when I got my Galaxy Nexus(Verizon), the app wasn't supporting it. My question is, will we ever get Voodoo Control support? It's been awhile since the phone came out but the app didn't get updated yet. This led me to assume that it's either impossible or the developer dropped its support. If it will not get Voodoo Control, what other choices are there? I'm currently using Volume+ and have tried PowerAMP, Neutron, and PlayerPro. All these do are some EQ and volume increase. They have nothing to do with hardware level sound modification.

When I get to step 9, recovery mode, I just see a yellow exclaimation-mark icon over a phone icon. I can reset my phone to OEM settings, but I can't see any menu or enable SU/Root. I tried copying the rectools.tar.gz to my root folder (I assume this is the folder that opens as a drive when you plug in to your PC via USB and select "open files/folder" -- I think you need Mass Storage mode enabled though). Is that the right place? Also, even if I reset and then just run straight recovery (without running fastboot to flash first), I see the same screen. What am I missing?

0	Are there cases where Android would start an app/service other than due to Intents or explicit user start?	launcher task-management multitasking processes	I'm trying to understand how/why some of the processes that are running on my phone (DroidX, stock 2.2 ROM). It's obvious that 2 likely reasons for a process to start are: A direct action by the user/another program to start it (e.g. click on the icon of an app, or another process launches the .apk explicitly) An Intent is registered by the app, and the event associated with that intent happens. The question is, are there other reasons/causes/mechanisms by which a process could be started in Android? ( aside from Intents or direct launch). P.S. As a plausible theory, something could be started off of init.rc (being how Android is based off of Linux) but I don't know enough about Android internals to judge if it launches any apps via init.rc

0	Why does it take so long for a program like Mapdroid to use the GPS to track you on a map	gps gps-tracking maps offline-map	I was in London last week ( which is outside my country, so I did not use roaming to connect to the internet to be able to use the maps application from Google ). In stead , I used Mapdroid to find my way around the center there. Mapdroid, for those who don't know this program, lets you download maps and than use them without data connection. The only thing you need to do is turn on the GPS. This works great apart for the fact that it can take between 5 and 10 minutes for the program to mark you location . If it does, it can track you fine , and it keeps tracking you on the map. But I am just wondering why it takes so long before Mapdroid knows where you are . Is it a hardware thing (I have a Samsung Galaxy S phone running Froyo).

0	How to keep display always off during the call on HTC Sense 4.1 (Android 4.0.1)?	4.0-ice-cream-sandwich calls screen htc-sense proximity-sensor	My wife has a problem with HTC Desire X (HTC Sense on Android 4.1) that during the call sometimes (in ~10% cases) the screens goes on for no reason. This cause phone calls to be canceled, loud speaker to be on, etc.I do not know how to reproduce it, but I was on another side of the line already many times when this problem has happened. The solution I see is to disable this "automatic on" feature. When the call button is pressed or the phone call is answered, the screen should go off and can be switched on only by pressing a hardware button (central or on/off button) and not by the proximity sensor. I could not find an application that can do this.... Is there any? If not, is it possible in theory to create such app without replacing the HTC Sence interface? ADDED: Are there maybe some other interfaces around that have such settings? In samsung or other devices??

0	My Milestone doesn't always charge	usb charging motorola-milestone	I have a Milestone and sometimes when I plug my (supplied Motorola) charger in the 'charging light' on the side does not illuminate and the phone does not charge. I think that this may also happen even after a successful initial connection (i.e. after plugging it in and getting the light) since occasionally I have unplugged the phone in the morning, after an overnight charge, and it is only 30% full (rather than the expected 100%).This problem is intermittent and sometimes rights itself but other times I need to reboot the phone. I have replaced the cable, and still have the same issue, so it is unlikely to be due to a faulty cable. This happens both when charging it from a wall socket or a USB port. Does anybody else have this problem? Or maybe have an idea of what it could be? edit: Faulty hardware may be the cause... I have seen similar posts about people having intermittent problems connecting their Milestones to USB ports, so I'm curious that this may be either a generic bug or a generic hardware fault, rather than just my phone.

0	Can I recover the events deleted from my phone local calendar?	backup recovery-mode calendar bugs lg	I have an LG P700. Yesterday I tried to use LG PC Suite to back it up. PC Suite got stuck at some point of the process and asked me to disconnect the phone and restart it, in spite that the screen of the phone had a warning not to touch it. I rashly followed the PC Suite instructions and restarted the phone. After doing so, I found that no backup had been created and all the events in Google Calendar had disappeared. Everything else in the phone seems to be working fine. I was using the phone local calendar, and I didn't have it synchronized to the cloud. About an hour before I started the PC Suite backup I set up the Backup &amp; Reset options for my Google account (Settings -> Backup &amp; Reset), so I understand that the phone started to back up itself automatically at that point. I don't know if this might help. So, is there any way to recover my lost events? I'm really crossing my fingers here 'cause I lost around 400 - 500 events.

But I have a Motorola Photon 4g which has got corrupted or some unstable ROM. I am facing 15-20 blackouts and restarts. This led to think like that. I want to know the procedure for flashing the very first time to phone. That is when the company manufactures the phone. It is has nothing. So they must follow some steps to make it alive.

0	How to list all major partitions with their labels?	mount partition command-line	I want to figure out all partitions on my device together with their resp. mount points or labels (i.e. to know which partition is holding system , recovery , boot , etc.). This needs to be device independent (as I have multiple devices). Goal is to dd them and know which image is what. I have seen Command to list partition mount points? however, there the goal was just a partition list of mounted partitions. I need them all, and e.g. /recovery is not mounted when booting into "normal work mode". So far, my recherche has brought up a bunch of approaches but none of them works on any of the devices I've tested: cat /proc/mtd : this is empty or non-existing cat /proc/emmc : this is empty or non-existing cat /proc/dumchar_info : non existing (MTK/MediaTek) ls -al /dev/block/platform/*/by-name : either non-existing, or not having the wanted details Any idea of what I could have missed? Of course I could walk all the /dev/block/mmcblk0p* devices, dump them, and sort them out later but then I had to repeat that investigation for every of my devices (and again when someone turns up with another one), so that's no solution. EDIT: Please note the command-line tag to this question. I'll have to access that information via ADB, and do not want to install some app on a device handed to me for investigation. Consider it "forensics background" (no changes to the device), though that's not exactly true ;) Also apologies for my initial mis-phrasing: the "mount points" are only interesting in so far they reveal the purpose of the partition. I don't want to mount/remount them :)

0	Space issues and rooting	2.2-froyo rooting app2sd internal-storage huawei-u8150	I have a Huawei IDEOS u8150 running Froyo. Ever since I got this device, I've been running into low disk space problems (because of only 150 MB internal space). So I've had enough and moved all the apps I can to SD card. Then again, some were not movable. So I did a little research and saw this article on loading apps to the SD card by default . It seemed to work rather weirdly, as some apps which couldn't be moved to the SD card before, now can be moved after using that trick. Still, the system apps and vendor bundled apps remained in the internal memory. Also, most of the moved apps still took some space on the internal memory. The Froyo's app2sd rather seems to be behaving oddly according to me (though I've searched online and found this is normal, sadly). What I want to know is : Will rooting enable me to further enhance my Froyo's app2sd function? Will custom mods be a better option with space management for my phone? If so, which ones? Right now I have apps that I really need and use and I'm stuck with low disk space. (Please dont link me to anywhere; I've done all I can with cleared caches and I have no more apps to uninstall which I don't need.) I've heard that z4root takes 22MB+ internal space. Is there anything else to root using adb or something that wont require internal space? Or if I use z4root itself, can I remove the app fully after rooting and still have root? What about SuperOneClick's space cost?

0	Is full device encryption possible on LG Optimus L5 II (LG-E460)?	encryption lg-optimus-l5-2	After starting the encryption process from within the Device Policy Manager for Google Apps the device will reboot, and immediately get stuck on the boot loader while happily displaying the LG logo until it runs out of power. Reinstalling the software image using the LG Mobile Support Tool makes no difference. It successfully installs the software, reboots the phone - and we're back to the permanent LG logo again. Naturally I assumed I had a problem with the specific device, so I then went ahead and bricked a second LG-E460 in the exact same way. Any way to fix the boot problem? While reinstalling the software made no difference, a hard factory reset (triggered by holding down power, volume down and quickset) let the device return to a bootable state. Can the LG-E460 be set up with encryption at all? Any reason as to why it might not work? I kinda thought of storage encryption as more of a universal Android thing and never considered that a mid range phone might not have such features. Lack of such essential security features would reduce these phones to children's toys in my eyes. Even if I could work around my personal security concerns, in these parts, full device encryption is very much a requirement to access just about any business related system or network, or even to sync contacts, schedule and mail with company services. 
0	Can someone recommend a ROM and kernel for the Galaxy S2 that works fully?	rom kernel	I have installed a kernel and ROM onto my Samsung Galaxy S2. However, it's been giving me a lot of problems. First the Compass didn't work, then when the compass was fixed by installing a patch the WiFi stopped working, then when I reinstalled the ROM to get Wifi back, I lost the compass again... I very much appreciate all the efforts that people who make kernels and ROMs put into it, and I understand that sometimes errors and problems can't be helped. So this is not a complaint. It's just that I'd like to wipe my phone, start clean, and install a kernel and/or ROM that I can be sure will work. I've already learned how to flash and install kernels and ROMs, and I've got my purchased version of Titanium Backup ready so I can reinstall all my apps... Just before I go through the whole effort, I'd like to be sure that the kernel and ROM I'm using are as certain to be fully functional and error free as one can hope. So can someone recommend a kernel and ROM that I can or should use?

0	My dialler app is severely lagging	calls dialer htc-sensation	I have a HTC Sensation running Android 4.0.3 (HTC Sense 3.6, 3.33.401.53). Of late I've been having increasing problems with global lag, however this is really most noticeable on the dialler/phone app itself. By more noticeable, I mean several times worse compared to anything else. I can open the contacts menu in the dialler without difficulty and filter by name to get the number I want up, however I get no response when I click the name (aside from a green flash of it to indicate I've pressed sucessfully). There's then a pause of I would say up to a minute in the worst cases before it actually dials. Usually I've pressed it multiple times in the hope of it working, whereupon it calls the person multiple times and I end up with several calls to the same person 'on hold'. Is there any known cause for this or even better any likely way to fix it? I could do a factory reset if this doesn't get resolved as it makes the phone close to unusable. The effect isn't really on answering calls, though there is a lag on that too (but not to anywhere near the degree).

And now when I insert my old card in my phone again I cannot access data of my old card through the phone as the phone says the format is incorrect or the card is damaged and in order to use it I need to format it again.

0	How do I distinguish apps with in-app purchases from completely free apps on Google Play?	google-play-store	As far as I can tell, Google does not provide a mechanism for searching for completely free apps in Google Play. When using the FREE filter, you get both completely free apps and apps with in-app purchases, where some elements are unavailable without paying, so they are not completely free. In some categories, most of apps' content is available via in-app purchases only, so it's misleading to have such apps in the free list. In the Google Play application, I am able to detect that an app isn't completely free If I open the details page and see "In-app purchases" on the left side. It is inconvenient having to open every app page just to verify this, but at least it's a workaround. Is there some way to include that criteria into the search function? Additionally, when searching Android apps through a desktop browser (Chrome) instead of the Google Play app on the device, "in-app purchases" does not appear to be displayed, even in the details page of the app. The question: How to detect or filter out apps that are not completely free, on Google Play?

0	Android - Phone storage full	internal-storage insufficient-memory	I have a Samsung Galaxy Ace. Every time I try to install a new App I get a message saying my internal memory is full (the SD card has plenty of room). The phone has 180MB of internal storage. I counted the memory that all my apps should take and it came out to 50MB so something is taking up 130MB and I don't know what that is. I rooted my device and moved all the apps that could be moved to the SD card. It still says that I have only 20 free MB. I was wondering if there are any apps out there that can tell me what is taking up all my memory. If not is there any way to programmatically map out the internal storage of the device? Does Android block access to this storage, or can I view it from my computer in any way?

0	Screen orientation on Samsung Galaxy 9000	samsung-galaxy-s screen orientation	When I have my samsung galaxy 9000 (with Android 2.2) on a flat surface (table) and start an application, then the application is shown in landscape mode, even when the start/home screen was in portrait mode.

Update: I think I got something wrong: the home screen is never rotated, so the problem is simply that the galaxy thinks it is in landscape-mode when it is lying flat. 
0	Having Strangers' Names in Caller ID Display	2.3-gingerbread contacts callerid carriers	Tired of not being able to tell who's calling me at all, I ended up putting out the additional monthly cost and getting caller ID display in my phone plan. And since I took it, I... still cannot tell who's calling me most of the time. Let me explain. When you have a home phone and have caller ID display in your plan, it displays the number of the person calling you as well as the name associated to that number in the phonebook. But that doesn't happen on my mobile phone. Unless it's a contact of mine, it's Unknown / No name that comes with the number. But the absence of such information makes the feature half as useful as home phone caller ID display (for the same price >_>). I realise this is more of a network / carrier issue, and that there's probably no way for me, myself, to change it (or is there? :D), but I'm wondering if there's a workaround. For example, a way for me to create my own phonebook with some names. Of course, I could just add them to my contacts, but adding people who aren't actually contacts would clutter my contacts list a ton. And categories don't really work on my phone. you can't manage them on the phone at all. You need to create contacts at the root of the contacts, and then log in to the Google website with your computer and sort them. So... Yeah. Is there any remotely convenient way for me to "fix" caller ID display, so I know who is that non-contact who's calling? Edit: I forgot to say. I did ask my provider about it. They said the system is different for mobile and home phones and they can't do anything about it. My phone: Samsung Galaxy Q (SGH-T589W) Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread Processor: 600MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 Internal storage: 152 MB RAM: 279 MB SD card: 2 GB Carrier: Videotron

No need to think about it anymore, also I can't give any further details. I have a quite new Samsung Galaxy S3 4G (GT-I9305). It is running an unmodified &amp; unrooted version of Android 4.1.2. It works mostly perfectly fine, but there is a slight problem with NFC. I have edited the buttons visible in the notification center. I have added the NFC switch to the buttons. My problem is, the button is not working. It is disabled, and has no green/gray indicator. However, when I tap the S Beam button S Beam and NFC get enabled. After this, if I tap NFC with S Beam either enabled or disabled, System UI crashes. When the UI reappears the buttons are as before tapping NFC, but now I can successfully turn off NFC, and also turn it on and off again. Restarting the phone brings the problem back again. Another way to get NFC turned on while the button is disabled is to go to Settings > More Settings and turn NFC on. This also turns NFC on in the notification center, but again, trying to turn it off causes System UI to crash. What could be causing this behavior?

It is an Exchange mailbox but I did not want to to use MAPI and have my device "managed" by the school. Anyhow, this worked fine prior to 4.2.2 update. Ever since then, e-mail is not being synchronized automatically and requires me to manually press the synchronize button.

If I go to the client and manually hit refresh though, I do get the message pulled. Also, if I restart the phone, all the new messages get pulled as well. Things I've checked: Factory reset : Reluctantly did one yesterday but, unfortunately, did not fix the issue. System Settings -> Accounts -> Email : The synchronize button icon is green, when I click on the account, "Email" setting is checked. Says "Last synced" with a time that's over 5 minutes ago.

Wifi vs. Mobile Data : I've tested on both and no difference in results. Does anyone have any suggestions on things I should check or test to figure this out. 
0	Deleting Pictures through adb - Yet They Remain in Gallery	camera adb	I'm attempting to write a script to test out a camera for long periods of time, and one of the issues right now is the fact that it runs out of space when pictures are taken. My initial approach is to remove the picture using adb after its taken. The issue is, even after I remove it from the location it is saved in, it remains visible in the gallery, and I assume it's taking up space somewhere. The properties associated with it (such as width, height, flash info, etc) all get deleted as well, except for the size. What I'm currently doing is deleting all files in the DCIM directory (where the camera saves the pictures) after every time a picture is taken, using adb. Additionally, when I search throughout the phone using adb, I cannot find anything similar to the pictures anywhere in the file structure. Is it possible to fully delete the pictures using adb? Is there a cache where the images are stored somewhere? The only way I can get the pictures to fully be removed from the phone are to either reboot, or use monkey runner to delete the pictures through simulated touches in gallery (which is tedious for a large # of photos).

0	After splash screens, Moto G screen goes black. Stock recovery won't start either. What to do?	boot motorola-moto-g	I have a one-year old Moto G (1st Gen) that suddenly today refuses to boot usefully (a boot loop? Not sure.), has a blank dark screen but backlight stays on. Tried to restart it using the power off button. I get the splash screens &amp; a startup vibrate but then the same dark screen. Succeeded in getting it to the boot menu (Version 41.13; Battery OK; Device is locked; Status Code 0) using power + volume key press. If I try selecting recovery it reports "Boot up failed". Selecting any of the other options on the boot menu just brings me back to the original dark screen + backlight. Any other things I can try? Phone is out of warranty so trying doesn't hurt me. If I keep the phone on the dark screen it gets warm. Not sure if that's merely the backlight or there's some hung processes running. Ideas? Edit 1: Some more information: Yes, I've an alternate phone that I can use in the meantime. No custom ROMs etc. were ever installed on this phone or even attempted to be installed. The phone was purchased new without any contract. It is running the Stock Google-Motorola Android. Have not tried installing any custom recovery MOds yet. Tried contacting Motorola using their online chat and went through the troubleshooting steps he advised. Nothing fruitful. He has asked me to call their Level 2 Support. I will on Monday. The only procedure I found to get into Safe Mode asks to keep the on screen soft power off button long pressed and wait for a prompt. I cannot get an on screen power button so not sure how I can get into safe mode. History before the problem occurred: Phone was in a call in progress. Suddenly had a lot of popups warn that various applications were being terminated. After that it went into this blank screen unresponsive state. No recent phone drops or other mishaps. The one thing that I have gotten to work from the boot menu is a menu

However when I go to Settings -&gt; More -&gt; Application manager and swipe once to the right the following screen shows up (click to enlarge): As you can see, it looks as though I've downloaded these applications to an SD Card despite the fact that such SD Card on my system does not exist. Can someone be so kind as to explain what this screen is displaying? Perhaps internal storage and internal memory are both synonymous with internal SD, but I'm not sure and would like clarification. And if this were true, then is this screen displaying applications stored on both the internal as well as the optional external SD card, or just the internal SD card? Thanks. Also, what is the gray rectangular area just below USB storage at the bottom of the screen for? My device doesn't have any USB sockets despite the one at the bottom of the device used to recharge the device or transfer files. What is this USB storage? Does the SD card appear as a USB device? Perhaps the external SD card when present appears to the Android OS as a USB device. If not, then what does USB have to do with this screen? Thanks. EDIT: I just checked this information on the Samsung Galaxy S Plus. Here is a screenshot ofthe breakdown of storage which is broken down among internal phone storage (and personal data which seems to me at least like it's the same thing), internal SD card, and external SD card. So, my guess is that not all phones are the same. This screen was accessed by long-pressing the Home hardware button, clicking on the Task Manager button, and then clicking on Storage. <a

I could still see the 2 contacts that were on my SIM-card, and I have no contacts on my external SD-card.

It's not catastrophic since I have all my contacts synchronized with Outlook, although, I will be losing the contacts added after my last sync. But I would really like to avoid to have this happen again in the future, and if possible recover my lost contacts.

They all say that there isn't a limit on how much video you can record. I want to record class lectures, they run about 2 hours long. I set up the camera and tap record. Camera runs properly for about 30 minutes then says "Maximum File Size Reached" and stops recording. This happens to occur at a file size of 4GB about where you'd expect fat32 issues to occur. This is a Samsung SGH I337 from ATT Android Version 4.2.2 Here's what I've tried. The camera is set to record to the SD card. The SD card is exfat formatted. I can drop a 16GB .iso onto the card from my windows 7 computer through the phone via the usb cord with no issues. This leads me to believe there isn't a file size limitation from the format of the card. The SD card is NOT full it is a 65GB card with 40GB free. Does anyone know of an app or a tweak that will let me record unlimited video within the real constraints of my hardware, 50GB's of 1080P video at a time or until battery failure? Thanks for your time. 
0	Boot Loop issue	boot-loop external-sd	 Summary by Izzy It seems the SD card in the LG Marquee has some errors causing a boot loop once the Media Scanner runs (or immediately when it's finished). Taking out the card seems to solve the issue, but then its content cannot be accessed. The original post is... TL;DR I'm a new user and I'm having a terribly annoying problem with my phone. I have an LG Marquee with Boost Mobile . A few hours ago, I opened up my gallery and the screen froze, then a force-close option popped up (which happens a lot with this phone so I'm used to it &amp; thought it'd just force-close &amp; then go back to normal as usual). Instead, the screen went blank &amp; the blue icons (home, options, back, search) started flashing. My phone had restarted completely: I had no service, my wallpaper was blank, etc. My phone does this a lot actually, but will just go back to normal. This time it started up normal, but the SD card icon appeared on my notifications bar &amp; it read "checking SD card for errors". Typically this would occur but then the "Media Scanner is Running" icon would appear &amp; my phone would be fine. The "media scanner running" pop up never appeared, and the blue icons just started flashing again as the screen went blank, only to reboot once again. My phone kept rebooting itself repeatedly for about an hour every minute or two (making it impossible to make a call or send a text!!) Then I finally just turned it off. Every time it'd reboot, it'd last a couple minutes &amp; the "media scanner running" pop up would come up, then it'd reboot all over again. Seems as though the media scanner triggers the reboot :/ After reading through many posts on the Internet about this issue, I tried a few things. In attempting to fix the problem, I realized that this issue has nothing to do with my phone itself or the battery - it's the SD card. I haven't dropped my phone at all la

Here is what I've tried: In Settings -> Security -> Device Administrators: Ensure everything is unchecked (nothing was) In Settings -> Security -> Clear Credentials: No errors received Tried booting into recovery and do 2 different wipe / factory resets. Am I missing something here? Why can't I set my screen lock / pattern? 
0	What are the advantages of Android apps being single threaded?	applications	I read a statement on http://developer.android.com that said: When an application is launched, the system creates a thread of execution for the application, called "main." This thread is very important because it is in charge of dispatching events to the appropriate user interface widgets, including drawing events. It is also the thread in which your application interacts with components from the Android UI toolkit. The system does not create a separate thread for each instance of a component. All components that run in the same process are instantiated in the UI thread, and system calls to each component are dispatched from that thread. I just wanted to know why Android has opted for this single threaded model architecture and not gone for multi-threaded. What are the advantages that they are getting out of this?

0	Downloading a .ics file from a url without opening the browser?	calendar	Ok, this is a little complicated. My uni allows my academic calendar to be downloaded as an ics file from a particular url that is specific to my calendar. I have downloaded ICS Bot which transfers ics files into google calendar so I can view it on my HTC Sensation in a calendar. If I download the .ics file and then the calendar's events change I will not have the up to date events. Therefore I need to regularly update the calendar myself by downloading the updated .ics file from the url. I want an app/a single button that can download my .ics file without me having to open my browser, go to the page displaying my link and then clicking save as to get the new calendar. Is there a way to do this???Many many thanks.

I was thinking I could connect the tablet to a TV, but I don't want to purchase an HDMI cable before I have a sure method that will unroot my tablet. The serial starts with B6O, and since it's the backlight that's broken I can still see very limited parts of the screen.

0	Does Android have a "device driver" architecture?	hardware	Since 1990, when a new version of Windows comes out, the (only) thing that stops PC owners from upgrading is whether there are compatible device drivers for their hardware (network adapter device driver, display adapter device driver, printer device driver, etc.).

0	Restart sound engine in Android (4.1)	audio htc-desire-s aokp	I am Running AOKP on my HTC Desire S and it has a weird issue with sound - If I reboot the device with headphones plugged in, the sound (specifically the bass) is OK but if I remove the headphones and if any kind of sound is played through the Phone's speaker (a touch, a keystroke, a song, a notification anything) and then try to plug in the headphones again, the bass cracks. Of course, I have reported the issue to original developer who has ported the build, but for now if I could just restart the sound engine, I may be able to solve it temporarily. Is there any such service that runs or is there any way to do so? AOKP 4.1 milestone 1 EDIT : This is not an answer to my original question (so not putting as an answer) but this kind of solved my problem. Well when you lose bass, just plug the headphones in, call a number (I always call my customer care which is toll free and not human :P) wait for the ring, cut the call and Whoila! The bass is back! :D I know it sounds crazy, but it works!

I'm trying to help someone set up his Android phone - an LG Thrill 4G - to connect to his PC so he can text from his computer, back up his contacts, etc. I downloaded and installed the SDK. I used the SDK manager to install more stuff, including the Google USB driver. I can see the usb_driver folder in the Android SDK extras folder, and I can see .dll files inside (if I remember correctly). I've set the phone to have whatever USB box checked. And, of course, I went to the Device Manager (he's got Windows 7), right-clicked the phone, and tried finding drivers online and finding them on the computer. No dice. Something online said I should run the dpinst.exe file and that it should be in the usb_driver folder. It isn't. Should this exist? Is there another way to get the driver to install? Should I take another route altogether? What am I missing?

All of a sudden, the native camera app started crashing - i.e. it opens and immediately closes. I don't know if the hardware camera is damaged, or if it's just the app. There have been no changes to my phone since it last worked - no new apps, no settings changes, nothing. Any ideas? Are there any other camera apps out there that I could download to replace the native one?

0	(How) can I get contacts with no name to display the Organization instead of "Unnamed" on my Android phone?	contacts htc-evo	I have an HTC Evo with contacts that were imported by Sprint from my old Palm Centro. On the Centro, I could have contacts with no name but a business/organization, and the contact list would use that as the display, and I could search on that field. (Handy for calling pizza restaurants!) On my new Android device, that sort of contact shows up as "Unknown", and the Organization name can't be searched. Is there a way to get the Android contact list to mimic the Palm's (quite reasonable and user-friendly!) behavior? Is there a quick way to copy the Organizations into the (say) Last Name field, if the above is not possible? What is the "right way" to deal with contacts that are businesses, not people, on Android devices?

Baseband Version is: N850B01 (first update after launch) Anything else I'd be happy to tell. I've tried flashing a ZTE Warp CW mod to it using some batch files, but it pauses at the "Waiting for device" when it's in recovery mode. It has a way to "apply update from SD card" but it needs a signed .zip and the ZTE Warp's ROMs don't work because its signatures fail (I think that's why).. If anyone out there could help me, I'd be more than happy to receive the help. Even if that means you experiment with the phone somewhat. (As long as it works at the end of the day.)

0	Nexus 7 ignores apple-touch-icon	4.1-jelly-bean bookmarks nexus-7	 Go to any website that has: &lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" /&gt;&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" /&gt; For example: bbc.co.uk , starbucks.com , or play.com . Create a bookmark from the browsers. Go to Bookmarks, and Add to Homescreen. On other Android devices, the icon that appears on your homescreen will be the icon specified in one of the two tags above. On my Nexus 7 though, it always uses a bookmark icon with the site's favicon in the middle. I know the icons are working, because if you go into Chrome => Bookmarks, it shows the bookmarks with the apple-touch-icon there, just not on the homescreen. Did this change in Jellybean? Is it a bug, or intentional for some reason? I can't find any mention of this behavior anywhere online.

0	Nexus 7 soft bricked, Need to recover data	nexus-7 unbricking data-recovery boot-loop	I don't know if I'm posting this on the right website or not, but I'll try anyway. I recently brought a Google Nexus 7 (non-SIM version). I've used it for around 3 months now and everything was working as normal until I left my battery to die whilst browsing online. The battery died overnight. In the morning, I charged my Nexus while attempting to use it at the same time. What I found at first was that the device would boot right up until the lock screen, but the device would state there was 0% battery and shut down. I then continually powered the Nexus a couple of times just to make sure it wasn't a minor hitch. Then, I noticed that the Nexus was actually looping from Boot to the X to the lock screen then back off. At one point, it was going to a static fuzzy screen then holding there. I did a little research and tried to boot it up via the Volume up + power method. After I tried this, the multi-colored X just holds on start up. It shows the white Google logo, then the Nexus logo and hangs there. I found out that the device could be "Soft bricked" and needs some sort of wipe. But here is my main concern: I never thought the device would break after three months, so I never really backed up any photos. I really would like to find a way to access the folders on the Nexus while it is soft bricked or fix the device without losing the photos. I'm even prepared to rip apart the device voiding any warranties and look for the memory card or whatever is inside. Under normal circumstances. I would just accept a loss, but these photos are of my baby where I haven't had my camera at hand. It has photos of her first moments, so they are worth a lot in sentimental value. If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it. I would appreciate the time and effort spent solving this problem. Thank you. P.S. I have no idea how technical stuff works on a deep level :( Anya x~

Due to a bug in ClockworkMod Recovery, it got wiped the other day. I had been manually backing up my entire card to my local computer every so often, but it was a manual process. I have a Box.com account. I have a Dropbox account. I have a Google Drive account. I want to automate uploading everything to one of those services (preferably Box, as I got in on the 50GB promo they did). I'm assuming this exists as a free or one-time purchase app, but all I can find are "back up services" that require a subscription. I use Titanium Backup to back up my apps, I take full images of my phone via CWM every so often, but I can't pass all that data to the cloud (well, TiBu will upload to Box/Dropbox, but that's not everything). Dropbox has a built-in image backup that will automatically upload any pictures I take to my account. Google+ can do the same to my G+ account. However, that's still only a portion of what exists on my internal storage. I want something that will grab everything else. Ideas?

As soon as I updated these, the notifications play the sound I had set, but now annoyingly they also vibrate. I have been into the settings for each app and there is no option for vibrate. I have searched through all the settings in my phone and can't find an option for notifications vibrating anywhere. I don't know how or why it turned on, but I want it off. The only option I have at the moment is to have my phone on silent all the time, or to turn the push notifications off. Which means that I will lose out in the games. I know it's not very important but I have spent a lot of time on these games and it would be a shame to get rid of them. Thank you. :-)

0	Where are dialer's "All Contacts" coming from?	4.4-kitkat dialer motorola-moto-g	Stock Moto G running 4.4.2, initially set up using Motorola Migrate to transfer my data from an HTC Desire S. I have Google, Skype, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts on my phone, and all the correct contact details from all those accounts are shown in the People app. Happy days. The fun starts when I open the dialer, and select "All Contacts". Here I see all sorts of ancient contacts who did once exist on my previous phone(s), some of whom I may have called at some point but most of whom I never have. They don't exist in the People app, or in the Call History, or on my SIM card&mdash;indeed, if I tap one of them to look at their details, there's an "Add to My Contacts" button there. Some of them are contacts that I used to have on my phone 1 or 2 phones ago and long since deleted, others appear to be old details for contacts that I have since updated or renamed. Where have these ghosts come from, and how can I banish them? 
0	How can I get the Amazon Appstore to stop re-installing applications?	applications amazon-appstore	Whenever I install an app through the Amazon store, I usually set my phone down while I wait for the download, and pick it up afterward to hit the "Install" button when the OS prompts me. Sometimes I won't do this immediately. It seems that the Appstore assumes the install failed if it wasn't completed within a certain length of time, and tries again. This is fairly short (a minute or two) and sometimes it might be hours before I go back to my phone. Until recently this wasn't a problem; I'd either just hit Install twice, or Install once and Cancel once, and move on. Now, however, the Appstore seems to get stuck in a loop. No matter how many times I hit Cancel or Install, it just repeatedly asks me to install the app. I have to kill the Appstore and/or reboot my phone, ruining any other updates I have queued. Then I have to wait for them again, and I'll probably forget about my phone for a few seconds too long and run into this issue again. Is there any way to make the Appstore behave reasonably? 
0	How can I automatically freeze and thaw an app on demand?	automation titanium-backup disable-app	I have some apps that I open on occasion. One in particular is a game that likes to push notifications up reminding me to play again. Is there an app I can use to automatically freeze an Android app when I exit it, and automatically thaw and open the app when I want to open it again? I hate how many apps have background services or receive intents that I don't care for. With my ROM, I can specifically deny permissions to apps based on certain intents, but that doesn't always help. I know you can freeze and thaw an app using Titanium Backup Pro, which I have. But that would require manually going in to TiBu and doing the freeze/thaw commands each time. In an ideal world, I would like a list of apps to be frozen as soon as I exit. And instead of the app listed in my app drawer, I would have a shortcut to first thaw the app and then open it (and have the same icon as the app). I don't care if this takes an extra few seconds; I simply want certain apps to only be running when I say so. Does this exist in any form on Android, whether in a kernel patch, an app, or a simple script?

It works like a charm on every device, that has original system (i.e. first Galaxy Tab, first Google Nexus etc.). When I'm trying to do the same on my old LG GT540 , which has non-standard Cyanogen Mod 7 ROM, download process fails. I don't get any extra information, only download manager adds status bar notification, that download failed and I can try to restart it, by touching that notification (no effect). This is first time I run into such situation. I've heard many times about many factors that could prevent installation of .apk file, but never about not being able to download it. My Internet connection is just fine, and this is related to .apk files only. I can download any other file types using web browser. I can also install .apk files manually, once I deliver them by cable to phohe. Has anyone else got similar experience or know, what is going on here?
